Impeachment Hearings - Day 2: Yovanovitch
November 19, 2019 @ 02:30 pm ET


ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:00:08.290 - 00:00:35.257]: It will come to order. Good afternoon. This is the fourth in a series of public hearings, the committee will be holding as part of the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry without objection. The chair is authorized to declare a recess of the committee. At any time there is a quorum present, we will proceed today in the same fashion as are other hearings. I'll make an opening statement and then the ranking member will have an opportunity to make his opening statement and we will turn to our witnesses for opening statements and then to questions with that.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:00:35.257 - 00:01:02.224]: I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J Trump, the forty fifth President of the United States. This afternoon we will hear from two witnesses requested by the minority Ambassador, Kurt Volker, the State Department Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations; and Tim Morrison, the senior former senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:01:02.224 - 00:01:29.191]: I appreciate the minorities request for these two important witnesses as well as Undersecretary of State David Hale from whom we will hear tomorrow. As we have heard from other witnesses when Joe Biden was considering whether to enter the race for the presidency, in 2020, the President's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani began a campaign to weaken Vice President, Biden's Vice President Biden's candidacy by pushing Ukraine to investigate him and his son To clear away any obstacle to the scheme.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:01:29.191 - 00:01:56.158]: Days after the new Ukrainian President was elected Trump ordered the recall of Marie Ivanovich, the American ambassador in Kiev was known for pushing anti-corruption efforts. Trump also canceled Vice President, Mike Pence's, participation in the inauguration of President Selenski on May 20th and instead sent a delegation headed by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sunland and Ambassador Kurt Volker. These three returned from Kiev and briefed President Trump on their encouraging first interactions with the new Ukrainian administration.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:01:56.158 - 00:02:23.125]: Hopes that Trump would agree to an early meeting with Ukrainian President were soon diminished. However, when Trump pushed back according to Volcker, he just didn't believe it. He was skeptical and he also said that's not what I hear. I hear. You know, he's got some terrible people around him. President Trump also told them he believed that Ukraine tried to take him down.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:02:23.125 - 00:02:50.092]: He told the three amigos talk to Rudy and they did. One of those interactions took place a week before the July 25th phone call between Trump insulin ski and Ambassador. Volker had breakfast with Rudy Giuliani at the Trump Hotel walker testified that he pushed back on Giuliani's accusation against Joe Biden on July 22nd. Just days before Trump would talk to Zelinsky after Volcker had a telephone conference. With Giuliani and Andre earmark a top adviser to the Ukrainian President.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:02:50.092 - 00:03:17.059]: So the Giuliani could be introduced to Yarmouk on July 25th, the same day as the call between President Trump and Zelinsky, but before it took place Ambassador Volcker sent a text message to Yarmouk quote heard from the White House. Assuming President Z convinces Trump, he will investigate slash get to the bottom of what happened.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:03:17.059 - 00:03:44.026]: In 2016, we will nail down date for a visit to Washington. Good luck, exclamation point. Later that day. Donald Trump would have the now infamous phone call with Zelinsky in which he responded to Ukraine's appreciation for U.S. defense support and a request by President Lynskey to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles. By saying I would like you to do us a favor though and the favor involved, the two investigations that Giuliani had been pushing for into the Bidens and 2016 M. Volcker was not on the call. But when asked about what it reflected, he testified.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:03:44.026 - 00:04:10.994]: No President of the United States should ask a foreign leader to help interfere in a U.S. election. Among those listening in on the July 25th call was Tim Morrison, who had taken over as the NSC Senior Director for European affairs at the NSC only days before but had been briefed by his predecessor, Fiona Hill, about the irregular second channel that was operating in parallel To the official one lieutenant colonel Veneman.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:04:10.994 - 00:04:37.961]: And Ms Williams, from whom we heard this morning, like them, morrison emerged from the call troubled. He was concerned enough about what he heard on the July 25th call that he went to see the NSC legal adviser soon after it had ended. Colonel Vinson's fear was that the President had broken the law potentially.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:04:37.961 - 00:05:04.928]: But Morrison said of his concern that his concern was that the call could be damaging if it were leaked soon after this discussion with lawyers at the NSC, the call record was hidden away on a secure server used to store highly classified intelligence where remained until late September when the call record was publicly released.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:05:04.928 - 00:05:31.895]: Following the July 25th call, Ambassador Volker worked with Sunland and the Ukrainian President's close adviser Geir Mok on a statement that would satisfy Giuliani when earmarks sent over a draft that still failed to include the specific words, charisma and 2016 Giuliani said the statement would lack credibility.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:05:31.895 - 00:05:58.862]: M. Volcker then added both charisma and 2016 to the draft statement, while Volcker and Morrison were by late July. Aware that the security assistance had been cut off at the direction of the President and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. As Ukrainians became aware of the suspension of security assistance and the negotiations over the scheduling of a White House meeting between Trump and Zelinsky dragged on the pressure increased and any pretense that there was no linkage soon dropped away.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:05:58.862 - 00:06:25.829]: Morrison accompanied Vice President Pence to Warsaw on September 1st, where pensions, Lynskey met and Zelinsky raised the suspended security assistance. Following that meeting, Sunland approached Yarmouk to tell him that he believed that what could help move the aid was if the Ukrainian prosecutor general would go to the mike and announce that he was opening the charisma investigation on September 7th Ambassador Sunland had a telephone call with Trump and asked him what he wanted from Ukraine.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:06:25.829 - 00:06:52.796]: According to Morrison who spoke with Sunlen, after the call, Trump insisted that there was no quid pro quo, but President Zelinsky must personally announce the opening of the investigations and he should want to do it. Solomon also said that if President Zelinsky didn't agree to make a public statement about the investigations, U.S. and Ukraine would be at a stalemate, meaning it would not receive the much needed security assistance. Mawson had a sinking feeling after the call.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:06:52.796 - 00:07:19.763]: As he realized that the ask was now being directed at Zelinsky himself and not the prosecutor general General as Sunland had relayed to a senior Ukrainian aide in Warsaw on September 1st, President Trump claimed there was no quid pro quo his insistence that Zelinsky himself must publicly Announce the investigations or they'd be at a stalemate, made clear that at least two official acts a White House meeting and 400 million in military aid were conditioned on receipt of what Trump wanted investigations to help his campaign. The efforts, the Security investigations would continue for several more days, but appear to have abruptly ended soon after the three committees of Congress announced an investigation into the Trump Giuliani, Ukraine scheme.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:07:19.763 - 00:07:46.730]: Only then will the aid be released?

DEVIN NUNES [00:07:46.730 - 00:08:15.912]: And now recognize Ranking Member Nunez for any remarks. He would like to make Welcome back to act two of today's circus. Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to continue what the Democrats tell us is a serious somber and even prayerful process of attempting to overthrow a duly elected President. If they're successful, the end result would be to disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans who thought the President is chosen by the American people, not by 13 Democrat partisans on a committee that's supposed to be overseeing the government's intelligence agencies. And this isn't -- Isn't it strange how we've morphed into the impeachment committee, presiding over a matter that has no intelligent component whatsoever?

DEVIN NUNES [00:08:15.912 - 00:08:45.093]: Impeachment of course is the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, not the Intelligence Committee, but putting this farce in our court provides two main advantages for the Democrats. It made it easier for them to shroud their depositions in secrecy and it allowed them to avoid giving too big of a role in this spectacle to another Democrat committee chairman and whom the Democrat leaders obviously have no confidence who can possibly view these proceedings as fair. And impartial.

DEVIN NUNES [00:08:45.093 - 00:09:14.275]: They are being conducted by Democrats who spent three years saturating the airwaves with dire warnings that President Trump is a Russian agent and these outlandish attacks continue to this very day. Just this weekend in front of a crowd of Democratic Party activists. The chairman of this committee denounced President Trump as a profound threat to our democracy and vowed that we will send that charlatan in the White House back to the golden throne.

DEVIN NUNES [00:09:14.275 - 00:09:43.456]: You came from how can anyone believe that people who would utter such dramatic absurdities are conducting a fair impeachment process and are only trying to discover the truth. It's obvious the Democrats are trying to topple the President solely because they despise him because they promised since Election Day to impeach him.

DEVIN NUNES [00:09:43.456 - 00:10:12.638]: And because they're afraid he will win re-election next year, no witnesses have identified any crime or impeachable offense committed by the President. But that doesn't matter. Last week, the Democrats told us his infraction was asking for a quid pro quo. This week it's bribery, who knows what ridiculous crime they'll be accusing him of next week as witnesses.

DEVIN NUNES [00:10:12.638 - 00:10:41.819]: The Democrats have called a parade of government officials who don't like President Trump's Ukraine policy even though they acknowledge he provided Ukraine with lethal material military aid after the Obama administration refused to do so. They also resent his conduct of policy through channels outside their own authority. And control these actions, they argue contradict the so-called inter agency consensus.

DEVIN NUNES [00:10:41.819 - 00:11:11.001]: They don't seem to understand that the President alone is constitutionally vested with the authority to set the policy. The American people elect a President, not an inter agency consensus and of course our previous witnesses had very Lute knew very little new information to share in these hearings. That's because these hearings are not designed to uncover new information. They're meant to showcase.

DEVIN NUNES [00:11:11.001 - 00:11:40.182]: A handpicked group of witnesses who the Democrats determined through their secret audition process will provide testimony most conductive and conducive to their accusations. In fact, by the time any witness says anything here, people are actually hearing it for the third time. They heard it first through the Democrats, cherry picked leaks to their media sympathizers during the secret depositions and second when the Democrats published those deposition transcripts and a highly staged manner.

DEVIN NUNES [00:11:40.182 - 00:12:09.364]: Of course, there are no transcripts from crucial witnesses like Hunter Biden, who could testify about his well-paying job and the board of a corrupt Ukrainian company, or Alexander Chalupa, who worked on an election meddling scheme with Ukrainian officials on behalf of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.

DEVIN NUNES [00:12:09.364 - 00:12:38.545]: That's because the Democrats refused to let us hear from them. As for evidence we're left with. What we're left with is the transcript of the Trump Zelinsky phone call, which the President made public. That means Americans can read for themselves an unremarkable conversation with President Zelinsky, who repeatedly expressed satisfaction with the call.

DEVIN NUNES [00:12:38.545 - 00:13:07.727]: Afterward, the Democrats, however, claim President Zelinsky was being bribed and therefore he must be lying when he says Paul was friendly and posed no problems. There's some irony here for weeks. We've heard the Democrats bemoan the damage President Trump supposedly caused to the U.S., Ukrainian relations. But when the Ukrainian President contradicts their accusations, they publicly dismiss him as a liar.

DEVIN NUNES [00:13:07.727 - 00:13:36.908]: I may be wrong, but I'm fairly sure colony friendly foreign President newly elected a liar violates their so-called inter agency consensus. So overall, the Democrats would have you believe President Zelinsky was being blackmailed with a pause on lethal military aid that he didn't even know about that. President Trump did not mention to him and that diplomats have testified. They always assumed would be lifted, which it was without the Ukrainians undertaking. Any of the actions they were supposedly being coerced into doing this process is not serious.

DEVIN NUNES [00:13:36.908 - 00:14:06.090]: It's not sober and it is certainly not prayerful. It's an ambitious attack to deprive the American people of the right to elect a President. The Democrats don't like, as I mentioned chairman of this committee claims, that democracy is under threat if that's true.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:14:06.960 - 00:14:33.523]: It's not the President who poses the danger. You'll back thank the gentleman. We're joined this afternoon by Ambassador Kurt Volker and Mr. Timothy Morrison. MasterCard focus served in the U.S. foreign service for nearly 30 years working on European and Eurasian, political and security issues under five different Presidential administrations during the George W. Bush administration.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:14:33.523 - 00:15:00.087]: He served as the acting director for European and Eurasian affairs in the National Security Council and later as a deputy assistant Secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. In 2008, President Bush appointed Ambassador Volker to the United States Permanent Representative to NATO where he served until May 2009. In July 2017, Ambassador Volker was appointed to be the U.S. special Representative for Ukraine negotiations.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:15:00.087 - 00:15:26.650]: Serving in that position until he resigned in September, his pleasure to welcome Mr. Morrison back to the legislative branch where he served for almost two decades as a Republican staffer. He was a professional staff member for representing Marc Kennedy, Minnesota and Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona later. Mr Morrison served as the longtime policy director for the Republican staff of the House Armed Services Committee.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:15:26.650 - 00:15:53.213]: July 2018, Mr Morrison joined the National Security Council as senior director for countering weapons of mass destruction following the partner of Dr. Fiona Hill. In July 2019, Mr Morrison assumed the position of Senior Director for Russia and Europe, two final points before the witnesses are sworn first. Witnesses witness depositions as part of this inquiry were unclassified in nature and all open hearings will also be held at the unclassified level. Any information they touch on classified information will be addressed separately.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:15:53.213 - 00:16:19.777]: Second, Congress will not tolerate any reprisal threat of reprisal or attempt to retaliate against any U.S. government official for testifying before Congress, including you or of any of your colleagues, if you will both please rise and raise your right hand. I will begin by scoring U.N.. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. So help you God let the record show that the witnesses answered in the affirmative.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:16:19.777 - 00:16:46.340]: Thank you and please be seated. The microphones are sensitive, so please speak directly into them without objection, your written statements will also be made part of the record. With that Mr Morrison. You are recognized for your opening statement and immediately thereafter. Ambassador Volker, you're recognized for your opening statement.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:16:48.410 - 00:17:12.949]: Chairman Schiff Ranking Member Nunez and members of the committee. I appear before you today under subpoena to answer your questions about my time as senior director for European affairs at the White House and the National Security Council as related to Ukraine and U.S. security sector assistance. To that country?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:17:12.949 - 00:17:37.487]: I will provide you the most complete and accurate information I can, consistent with my obligations to protect classified and privileged information, whether the conduct that is the subject of this inquiry merits impeachment is a question for the U.S. House of Representatives. I appear here today only to provide factual information based upon my knowledge and recollection of events. I will not waste time restating the details of my opening statement from my deposition on October 31, 2019, which has recently been made public. However, I will highlight the following key points.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:17:37.487 - 00:18:02.026]: First, as I previously stated, I do not know who the whistleblower is, nor do I intend to speculate as to who the individual may be. Second, I have great respect for my former colleagues from the NSC and the rest of the interagency. I'm not here today to question their character or integrity. My recollections and judgments are my own. Some of my colleagues recollections of conversations and interactions may differ from mine.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:18:02.026 - 00:18:26.564]: But I do not view those differences as the result of an untoward purpose. Third, I continue to believe Ukraine is on the front lines of a strategic competition between the West and Vladimir Putin's revanchist, Russia. Russia is a failing power, but it is still a dangerous one. The United States AIDS Ukraine and her people, so they can fight Russia over there and we don't have to fight Russia here.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:18:26.564 - 00:18:51.103]: Support for Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty has been a bipartisan objective since Russia's military invasion in 2014. It must continue to be as I stated during my deposition. I feared at the time of the call on July 25th, how its disclosure would play in Washington's political climate. My fears have been realized.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:18:51.103 - 00:19:15.641]: I understand the gravity of these proceedings, but I beg you not to lose sight of the military conflict underway in eastern Ukraine today. The ongoing illegal occupation of Crimea and the importance of reform of Ukraine's politics and economy. Every day that the focus of discussion involving Ukraine is centred on these proceedings. Instead of those matters is a day when we are not focused on the interests Ukraine, the United States and Western style liberalism share.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:19:15.641 - 00:19:40.180]: Finally, I concluded my active service at the National Security Council. The day after I lost appeared before you left the NSC completely of my own volition. I felt no pressure to resign nor have I feared any retaliation. For my testimony, I made this career choice sometime before I decided to testify on October 30. First, I'm prepared to answer your questions to the best of my ability and recollection.

UNIDENTIFIED [00:19:40.200 - 00:19:40.620]: Thank you.

KURT VOLKER [00:19:40.620 - 00:20:11.090]: Investor Volker thank you very much, Mr. Chairman Ranking Member. Thank you very much for the opportunity to provide this testimony today. As you know, I was the first person to come forward to testify as part of this inquiry. I did so voluntarily and likewise voluntarily provided relevant documentation in my possession in order to be as cooperative, clear and complete as possible.

KURT VOLKER [00:20:11.090 - 00:20:41.561]: I'm here today voluntarily and I remain committed to cooperating fully and truthfully with this committee all I can do is provide the facts as I understood them at the time. I did this on October 3rd in private and I will do so again today. Like many others who have testified in this inquiry, I'm a career foreign policy professional.

KURT VOLKER [00:20:41.561 - 00:21:12.031]: I began my career as an intelligence analyst for northern Europe for the Central Intelligence Agency in 1986 before joining the State Department in 1988I served in diplomatic postings primarily focused on European political and security issues for over 20 years under Presidents. Ronald Reagan, George H.W, Bush Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

KURT VOLKER [00:21:12.031 - 00:21:42.502]: My last three positions before leaving the Senior Foreign Service in 2009, whereas director for NATO and West European affairs at the National Security Council, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European affairs at the State Department. And finally, as U.S. ambassador to NATO in the spring of 2017, then Secretary of State Tillerson asked if I would come back to government service as U.S. special Representative for Ukraine negotiations.

KURT VOLKER [00:21:42.502 - 00:22:12.972]: I did this on a part time voluntary basis with no salary paid by the U.S. taxpayer simply because I believed it was important to serve our country. In this way, I believed I could steer U.S. policy in the right direction for over two years as U.S. special Representative for Ukraine negotiations. My singular focus was advancing the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States in particular that meant pushing back on Russian aggression and supporting the development of a strong, resilient democratic and prosperous Ukraine, one that overcomes a legacy of corruption and becomes integrated into a Wider transatlantic community, this is critically important for U.S. national security.

KURT VOLKER [00:22:12.972 - 00:22:43.443]: If we can stop and reverse Russian aggression in Ukraine, we can prevent it elsewhere. If Ukraine, the cradle of Slavic civilization, predating Moscow succeeds as a freedom loving, prosperous and secure democracy. It gives us enormous hope that Russia may one day change, providing a better life for Russian people and overcoming its current plague of authoritarianism corruption aggression toward neighbors and threats to NATO and the United States.

KURT VOLKER [00:22:43.443 - 00:23:13.913]: The stakes for the United States in a successful Ukraine could not be higher at no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden. As you know from the extensive real time documentation I have provided. Vice President, Biden was not a topic of our discussions.

KURT VOLKER [00:23:13.913 - 00:23:44.383]: I was not on the July 25th phone call between President Trump and President Zelinsky. I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by President Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September 25th, 20, 19 from July 7, 2017 until September 27, 2019. I was the lead U.S. diplomat dealing with Russia's war on Ukraine.

KURT VOLKER [00:23:44.383 - 00:24:14.854]: My role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel I reported directly to Secretaries of State Tillerson and Pompeo kept the national security adviser and Secretary of defense. Well informed of my efforts and worked closely with Ambassador Masha, Ivanovich NSC, Senior Director Hill and her successor. Jim Morrison then, assistant secretary, w Mitchell and his successor acting assistant secretary, Phil Reeker, Deputy Assistant Secretary, George Kent, deputy assistant secretary, defense lawyer, Cooper, NSC director, Alex Vinson and many, many others. I have known many of them for several years.

KURT VOLKER [00:24:14.854 - 00:24:45.324]: It was a team effort when Ambassador Yu Ivanovich left Keefe, identified and recommended Bill Taylor to Secretary Pam pale so we would still have a strong seasoned professional on the ground for two years before the events. At the heart of this investigation took place. I was the most senior U.S. diplomat visiting the conflict zone meeting with victims of Russia's aggression. Urging increased U.S. security assistance, including lethal defensive weapons, working with Ukrainian President, Poroshenko and then his successor President Zelinsky and their teams working with France and Germany in the so-called Normandy process pressing for support from NATO, the EU and OSCE supporting the OSCE special monitoring mission and Engaging in negotiations and other contacts with Russian officials at the time I took the position in the summer of 2017, There were major complicated questions swirling in public debate about the direction of U.S. policy toward Ukraine where the administration lift sanctions against Russia. Would it make some kind of grand bargain with Russia in which it would trade recognition of Russia's seizure of Ukrainian territory for some other deal in Syria or elsewhere?

KURT VOLKER [00:24:45.324 - 00:25:15.795]: Would the administration recognize Russia's claimed annexation of Crimea? Will this just become another frozen conflict? There are also a vast number of vacancies in key diplomatic positions. So no one was really representing the United States in the negotiating process about ending the war in eastern Ukraine during over two years of my tenure as U.S. special Representative.

KURT VOLKER [00:25:15.795 - 00:25:46.265]: We fundamentally turned U.S. policy around U.S. policy toward Ukraine with strong, consistent and enjoyed support across the administration, bipartisan support in Congress and support among our allies and Ukraine. We changed the language commonly used to describe Russia's aggression. I was the administration's most outspoken public figure highlighting Russia's invasion and occupation of parts of Ukraine, calling out Russia's responsibility to end the war I visited the war zone three times meeting with soldiers and civilians alike.

KURT VOLKER [00:25:46.265 - 00:26:16.735]: Always bringing media with me to try to raise the public visibility of Russia's aggression and the humanitarian impact on the lives of the citizens of the Donbas. We coordinated closely with our European allies and Canada to maintain a united front against Russian aggression and for Ukraine's democracy reform sovereignty and territorial integrity. Ukraine policy is perhaps the one area where the U.S. and its European allies had been in lockstep. This Gordon helped this coordination helped to strengthen U.S. sanctions against Russia and to maintain EU sanctions as well along with others in the administration.

KURT VOLKER [00:26:16.735 - 00:26:47.206]: I strongly advocated for lifting the ban on the sale of lethal defensive weapons or at least the defensive arms to Ukraine advocated for increasing U.S. security assistance to Ukraine and urged other countries to follow suit. My team and I drafted the Pompeii declaration of July 25th, 2018 in which the secretary clearly and definitively laid out the U.S. policy of non-recognition of Russia's claimed annexation of Crimea. I engage with our allies with Ukraine and with Russia in negotiations to implement the Minsk agreements. Holding a firm line on insisting on the withdrawal of Russian forces, dismantling of the so-called People's Republics and restoring Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity.

KURT VOLKER [00:26:47.206 - 00:27:17.676]: Together with others in the administration, we kept U.S. policy steady through Presidential and parliamentary elections in Ukraine and worked hard to strengthen the U.S. Ukraine bilateral relationship under the new President and government, helping shepherd in a peaceful transition of power in Ukraine. So in short, whereas two years ago, most observers would have said that time is on Russia's side by 2019. When I departed, we had turned the tables and time was now when Ukraine sighed.

KURT VOLKER [00:27:17.676 - 00:27:48.147]: It's a tragedy for the United States and for Ukraine that our efforts in this area, which were bearing fruit have now been thrown into disarray. One of the critical aspects of my role as U.S. special Representative was that as the most senior U.S. official appointed to work solely on the Ukraine portfolio, I needed to step forward to provide leadership if we needed to adopt a policy position.

KURT VOLKER [00:27:48.147 - 00:28:18.617]: I made the case for it, if any, if we needed to, if anyone needed to speak out publicly, I would do it when we failed to get a timely statement about Russia's illegal attack on Ukraine's, Navy and seizure of Ukraine's sailors. I tweeted about it in order to condemn the act. If a problem arose, I knew it was my job to try to fix it. That was my perspective.

KURT VOLKER [00:28:18.617 - 00:28:49.088]: When I learned in May 20, 19 that we had a significant problem that was impeding our ability to strengthen our support for Ukraine's new President. In his effort to ramp up Ukraine's fight against corruption and implementation of needed reforms, I found myself faced with a choice to be aware of a problem and to ignore it or to accept that it was my responsibility to try to fix it. I tried to fix it. The problem was that despite the unanimous positive assessment and recommendations of those of us who were part of the U.S. Presidential delegation that attended the inauguration of President, Zelinsky President Trump was receiving a different negative narrative about Ukraine and Presidents Alinsky.

KURT VOLKER [00:28:49.088 - 00:29:19.558]: That narrative was fueled by accusations from Ukraine's then prosecutor general and conveyed to the President by former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. As I previously told this committee I became aware of the negative impact this was having on our policy efforts when four of us who were part of the Presidential Delegation to the inauguration met as a group with President Trump on May 20. Third, we stressed our finding that presence Alinsky represented the best chance for getting Ukraine out of the mire of corruption and had been in for over 20 years.

KURT VOLKER [00:29:19.558 - 00:29:50.028]: We urged him to invite President Zelinsky to the White House. The President was very skeptical given Ukraine's history of corruption. That's understandable. He said that Ukraine was a corrupt country full of terrible people. He said they tried to take me down in the course of that conversation, he referenced conversations with Mayor Giuliani.

KURT VOLKER [00:29:50.028 - 00:30:20.499]: It was clear to me that despite the positive news and recommendations being conveyed by this official delegation about the new President, President Trump had a deeply rooted negative view on Ukraine rooted in the past. He was receiving other information from other sources, including Mayor Giuliani that was more negative, causing him to retain this negative view within a few days.

KURT VOLKER [00:30:20.499 - 00:30:50.969]: On May 29, President Trump indeed signed the congratulatory letter to President Alinsky, which included an invitation to the present President to visit him at the White House. However, more than four weeks passed and we could not nail down a date for the meeting. I came to believe that the President's long held negative view toward Ukraine was causing hesitation in actually scheduling the meeting much as we had seen in our Oval Office discussion after weeks of reassuring the Ukrainians that it was just a scheduling issue.

KURT VOLKER [00:30:50.969 - 00:31:21.440]: I decided to tell President Selenski that we had a problem with the information reaching President Trump from Mayor Giuliani. I did so in a bilateral meeting at a conference on Ukrainian economic reform in Toronto on July 2nd, 2019 where I led the U.S. delegation. I suggested that he call President Trump directly in order to renew their personal relationship and to assure President Trump that he was committed to investigating and fighting corruption things on which President Zelinsky had based his Presidential campaign.

KURT VOLKER [00:31:21.440 - 00:31:51.910]: I was convinced that getting the two Presidents to talk with each other would overcome the negative perception of Ukraine that President Trump still harbored President Zelinsky senior aide, Andre Yarmouk approached me several days later to ask to be connected to Mayor Giuliani. I agreed to make that connection.

KURT VOLKER [00:31:51.910 - 00:32:22.380]: I did so because I understood that the new Ukrainian leadership wanted to convince those like Mayor Giuliani, who believed such a negative narrative about Ukraine that times have changed and that under President Zelinsky Ukrainians were Ukraine is worthy of U.S. support Ukrainians believe that if they could Get their own narrative in across in a way that convinced Mayor Giuliani that they were serious about fighting corruption and advancing reform. Mayor Giuliani would convey that assessment to President Trump, thus correcting the previous negative narrative.

KURT VOLKER [00:32:22.380 - 00:32:52.851]: I made sense to me and I tried to be helpful, I made clear to the Ukrainians, the mayor Giuliani was a private citizen, the President's personal lawyer and not representing the U.S. government. Likewise, in my conversations with Mayor Giuliani, I never considered him to be speaking on the President's behalf or giving instructions.

KURT VOLKER [00:32:52.851 - 00:33:23.321]: Rather, the information flow was the other way from Ukraine to Mayor Giuliani in the hopes that this would clear up the information reaching President Trump on July 10th. After hearing from Mr. Yair Monk, I wrote to Mayor Giuliani to seek to get together. And finally, on July 19th, we met for breakfast for a longer discussion at that meeting.

KURT VOLKER [00:33:23.321 - 00:33:53.792]: I told Mr. Giuliani that in my view, the prosecutor general with whom he had been speaking, Mr. Litt Sankoh was not credible and was acting in a self-serving capacity to my surprise, marriage Mayor Giuliani said that he had already come to that same conclusion. Mr Giuliani also mentioned both the accusations about Vice President Biden and about interference in the 2016 election and stressed that all he wanted to see was for Ukraine to investigate what happened in the past and apply its own laws concerning the allegations. I stress that no one in the new team governing Ukraine had anything to do with anything that may have happened in 2016. They were making television shows at the time.

KURT VOLKER [00:33:53.792 - 00:34:24.262]: I also said that it's not credible to me that former Vice President Biden would have been influenced in any way by financial or personal motives in carrying out his duties as Vice President. A different issue is whether some individual Ukrainians may have attempted to influence the 2016 election or thought they could buy influence.

KURT VOLKER [00:34:24.262 - 00:34:54.733]: That is at least plausible given Ukraine's reputation for corruption. But the accusation that Vice President Biden acted inappropriately did not seem at all credible to me after that meeting. I connected Mayor Giuliani and Mr. Yarrow monk by text and later by phone. They met in person on August 2nd, 2019. In conversations with me following that meeting, which I did not attend, Mr Giuliani said that he had stressed the importance of Ukraine conducting investigations into what happened in the past and Mr. year mock stressed that he told Mr. Giuliani. It is the government's program to root out corruption and implement reforms and they would be conducting investigations as part of this process. Anyway, Mr Giuliani said he believed the Ukrainian President needed to make a statement about fighting corruption and that he had discussed this with Mr. Yarmouk.

KURT VOLKER [00:34:54.733 - 00:35:25.203]: I said I did not think that this would be a problem since that is the government's position. Anyway, I followed up with Mr. Jarmon and he said that they would indeed be prepared to make a statement. He said it would reference Boris month and 2016 in a wider context of bilateral relations and rooting out corruption anyway.

KURT VOLKER [00:35:25.203 - 00:35:55.673]: There was no mention of Vice President Biden rather in referencing Boris mayor and 2016 election interference. It was clear to me that he Mr. earmark was only talking about whether any Ukrainians had acted inappropriately. At this time, I was focused on our goal of getting President Zelinsky and President Trump to meet with each other and I believed that they are doing so would overcome the chronically negative view President Trump had toward Ukraine. I was seeking to solve the problem I saw when we met with President Trump in the Oval Office on May 20. Third, as a professional diplomat, I was comfortable exploring whether there was a statement Ukraine could make about its own intentions to investigate possible corruption that would be helpful in convincing Mr. Giuliani to convey to President Trump a more positive assessment of the new leadership in Ukraine. On August 16th, Mr. Monk shared a draft with me, which I thought looked perfectly reasonable.

KURT VOLKER [00:35:55.673 - 00:36:26.144]: It did not mention Barack Obama or 2016 elections, but was generic Ambassador song land. And I had a further conversation with Mr Giuliani, who said that in his view in order to be convincing that this government represented real change in Ukraine, the statement should include specific reference to charisma and 2016. Again, there was no mention of Vice President Biden in these conversations, Ambassador Sullivan and I discuss these points and I edited the statement drafted by Mr. earmark to include these points to see how it looked. I then discussed it further with Mr. Yarmouk.

KURT VOLKER [00:36:26.144 - 00:36:56.614]: He said that for a number of reasons, including the fact that Mr. looked Sankoh was still officially the prosecutor general. They did not want to mention Mauresmo or 2016. I agreed and the idea of putting out a statement was shelved. These were the last conversations I had about this statement, which were on or about August 17 to 18. My last contact with Mr. Giuliani, according to my records, was on August 13th until he tried to reach me on September 20th after the impeachment inquiry was launched. At this time that is to say in the middle of August, I thought the idea of issuing this statement had been definitively scrapped in September.

KURT VOLKER [00:36:56.614 - 00:37:27.085]: I was surprised to learn that there had been further discussions with the Ukrainians about President Zelinsky, possibly making a statement in an interview with U.S. media similar to what we had discussed in August since these events and since I gave my testimony on October 3rd, a great Deal of additional information and perspectives have come to light.

KURT VOLKER [00:37:27.085 - 00:37:57.555]: I've learned many things that I did not know at the time of the events in question. First, at the time, I was connecting Mr. Yarmouk and Mr. Giuliani and discussing with Mr. Yarmouk and Ambassador Saul and a possible statement that could be made by the Ukrainian President. I did not know of any linkage between the hold on security assistance and Ukraine pursuing investigations.

KURT VOLKER [00:37:57.555 - 00:38:28.025]: No one had ever said that to me and I never conveyed such a linkage to the Ukrainians. I oppose the hold on U.S. security assistance as soon as I learned about it on July 18th. And I thought we could turn it around before the Ukrainians ever knew or became alarmed about it. I did not know the reason for the hold, but I viewed it as a U.S. policy problem that we needed to fix internally and I was confident we would do so. I believe the Ukrainians became aware of the hold on August twenty ninth and not before that date is the first time any of them asked me about the hold by forwarding. An article that had been published in Politico when I spoke to the Ukrainians about the hold. After August twenty ninth.

KURT VOLKER [00:38:28.025 - 00:38:58.496]: Instead of telling them that they needed to do something to get the hold released, I told them the opposite that they should not be alarmed. It was an internal U.S. problem and we were working to get it fixed. I did not know others were conveying a different message to them around the same time. Second, I did not know about the strong concerns expressed by then National Security Adviser John Bolton to members of his NSC staff regarding the discussion of investigations.

KURT VOLKER [00:38:58.496 - 00:39:28.966]: I participated in the July 10th meeting between National Security Adviser Bolton and then Ukrainian chairman of the National Security and Defense Council, Alex Dannielynn. As I remember, the meeting was essentially over when Ambassador song and made a general comment about investigations. I think all of us thought it was inappropriate.

KURT VOLKER [00:39:28.966 - 00:39:59.437]: The conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded later on in the wardroom. I may have been engaged in a side conversation or had already left the complex because I do not recall further discussion regarding investigations or charisma. Third, I did not understand that others believed that any investigation of Ukrainian company Barrie's month, which had a history of accusations of corruption was tantamount to investigating Vice President Biden.

KURT VOLKER [00:39:59.437 - 00:40:29.907]: I drew a sharp distinction between the two. It has long been U.S. policy under multiple administrations to urge Ukraine to investigate and fight internal corruption. I was quite comfortable with Ukraine making its own statement about its own policy of investigating and fighting corruption at home. At the one in-person meeting I had with Mayor Giuliani, on July 19th, mayor Giuliani raised and I rejected the conspiracy theory that Vice President Biden would have been influenced in his duties as Vice President by money paid to his son.

KURT VOLKER [00:40:29.907 - 00:41:00.378]: As I previously testified, I have known Vice President Biden for 24 years. He is an honorable man and I hold him in the highest regard at no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden. And as you know from the extensive documentation, I provided Vice President, Biden was not a topic of discussion.

KURT VOLKER [00:41:00.378 - 00:41:30.848]: I was not on the July 25th phone call between President Trump and President Lynskey. I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by President Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September 25th, 20, 19. Throughout this time, I understood that there was an important distinction between Boris mutton bite and I urged the Ukrainians to maintain such a distinction.

KURT VOLKER [00:41:30.848 - 00:42:01.318]: I did not know that President Trump or others had raised Vice President Biden with Ukrainians where I conflated the investigation of possible Ukrainian corruption with investigation of the former Vice President. In retrospect for the Ukrainians, it would clearly have been confusing. In hindsight, I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving Ukrainian company, Boris MMA as equivalent to investigating former President, Vice President Biden.

KURT VOLKER [00:42:01.318 - 00:42:31.789]: I saw them as very different, the former being appropriate and unremarkable the latter being unacceptable. In retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently and had I done so I would have raised my own objections. Fourth, much has been made of the term three amigos in reference to Secretary Perry, Ambassador Solon myself.

KURT VOLKER [00:42:31.789 - 00:43:02.259]: I've never used that term and frankly cringe when I hear it, because for me the three amigos will always refer to Senator McCain, Senator Lieberman and Senator Graham in reference to their work to support the surge in Iraq. Moreover, I was never aware of any designation by President Trump or anyone else putting Ambassador Sunland or the three of us as a group in charge of Ukraine policy.

KURT VOLKER [00:43:02.259 - 00:43:32.730]: Rather as I understood it, each of us in our own respective official capacities continued to work together after our attendance of presence Lewinsky's inauguration to push for greater U.S. support for Ukraine, leading the diplomacy around Ukraine. Negotiations have long been my official responsibility, but I welcome the added support and influence of a cabinet member and our EU ambassador. Fifth, I was not aware that Ambassador, someone spoke with President Trump on July 26, while Ambassador Taylor and I were visiting the conflict zone. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.

KURT VOLKER [00:43:32.730 - 00:44:03.200]: Allow me to thank you again for the opportunity to provide this testimony. I believe that U.S. foreign policy and national security interests in Ukraine are of critical importance and I'll be pleased to answer your questions.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:44:05.480 - 00:44:30.947]: Thank you, gentlemen, for your opening statements will now proceed to the first round of questions. As detailed in the memo provide the committee members only 45 minutes of questions conducted by the chairman or majority counsel, followed by 45 minutes for the ranking member or minority counsel. Following analysts, I specify additional equal time for extensive questioning will proceed under the five minute rule and every member will have a chance to ask questions.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:44:30.947 - 00:44:56.413]: I now recognize myself or counsel for the first round of questions and Mr. Volcker, I was going to just yield to the minority counsel, but there are a couple of points that you made in your opening statement that I wanted to ask about. First, first, you said that now former Attorney General Lute Sankoh was not credible?

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:44:56.413 - 00:45:21.880]: Mr. Sancho is the author of a number of allegations against Ambassador Ivanovich, a number of allegations that were shared with John Solomon of The Hill, a number of allegations that have been repeatedly brought up by my Republican colleagues. Why is it that you found Mr. that not credible and told Mr. Giuliani? So thank you, Mr. Chairman.

KURT VOLKER [00:45:21.880 - 00:45:42.968]: First off, the allegations themselves, including those against Ambassador Jovanovic, did not appear to me to be credible at all. I know her to be an incredibly competent professional. Someone I've worked with for many, many years. The suggestions that she was acting in some improper and inappropriate manner were not credible to me. I've known Vice President Biden for a long time.

KURT VOLKER [00:45:42.968 - 00:46:04.056]: Those accusations were not credible. And then separate from that, I also was aware of the political situation in Ukraine. We had a situation where President Poroshenko appeared to not be in a favorable position going into the elections where it was increasingly apparent then candidate Zelinsky was going to win.

KURT VOLKER [00:46:04.056 - 00:46:25.144]: As is often the case in Ukraine, a change in power would mean change in prosecutorial powers as well. And there have been efforts in the past at prosecuting the previous government. I think Mr. Litt, Sankoh in my estimation, and I said this to Mayor Giuliani when I met with him, was interested in preserving his own position.

KURT VOLKER [00:46:25.144 - 00:46:46.232]: You wanted to avoid being fired by a new government in order to prevent prosecution of himself possible prosecution of himself possibly. Also this is something that President Poroshenko would have welcomed as well because he probably would have avoided any efforts to prosecute President Poroshenko as well.

KURT VOLKER [00:46:46.232 - 00:47:07.320]: So by making allegations like this and making sure they were reaching U.S. media, I think that Mr. Litt, Sancho is trying to make himself appear to be an important and influential player in the United States investor. Let me also ask you about the allegations against Joe Biden because that has been a continuing refrain from some my colleagues as well.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:47:07.700 - 00:47:14.970]: Why was it you found the allegations against Joe Biden related to his son or charisma, not to be believed?

KURT VOLKER [00:47:15.170 - 00:47:35.050]: Simply because I've known Vice President, former Vice President, Biden for a long time, I know how he respects his duties of higher office and it's just not credible to me that a Vice President of the United States is going to do anything other than act as how He sees best for the national interest.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:47:35.180 - 00:48:01.220]: And finally, Ambassador, before I turn it over, I was struck by something you said on page eight of your statement which reads In hindsight I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving Ukrainian company. Barry's MMA as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:48:01.220 - 00:48:27.260]: I saw them as different, the former being appropriate and unremarkable the latter being unacceptable. In retrospect, you said I should have seen that connection differently and had I done so I would have raised my own objections. What is it now Ambassador in retrospect that you recognized that you didn't at the time that lead you to conclude that you would or should have raised these objections and that others did not see the distinction between these things as I saw it?

KURT VOLKER [00:48:27.840 - 00:48:56.415]: As I said, there is a history of corruption in Ukraine. There is a history with the company of Boris Ma that's been investigated that is well-known. There is a separate allegation about the Vice President acting inappropriately. His son was a board member of this company. But those things I saw as completely distinct and what I was trying to do in working with the Ukrainians was to thread a needle to see whether things that they can do that are appropriate and reasonable was part of Ukraine's own policy of fighting corruption that help Clarify for our President that they are committed to that very -- that very effort.

KURT VOLKER [00:48:56.415 - 00:49:24.990]: There's a way to thread that needle. I thought it was worth the effort to try to solve that problem. As it turns out, I now understand that most of the other people didn't see or didn't consider this distinction that for them it was synonymous.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:49:25.210 - 00:49:43.485]: Well, one of those people who saw it's anonymous turns out to be the President. I'd states I take it, you didn't know until the call record was released that the President in that call doesn't raise Berrimah. He asked for an investigation of the Biden's. Is that right? That is correct. I take it since you say that you acknowledge that asking for an investigation of the Bidens would have been unacceptable and objectionable that had the President asked you to get Ukraine to investigate the Biden's, you would have told him. So I would have objected to that.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [00:49:43.485 - 00:50:01.760]: Yes, sir.

KURT VOLKER [00:50:01.760 - 00:50:23.473]: Mr. Goldman, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just one follow up on that ambassador Volker. When you say thread the needle, you mean that you understood the relationship between Vice President Biden's son and Boris Ma, But you were trying to separate the two of them in your mind. Is that right? Well, I believe that they were separate that and I references the conversation I had with Mr. Giuliani as well where I think that the allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and not credible. Separate question is whether it is appropriate for Ukraine to investigate possible corruption of Ukrainians that may have tried to corrupt things or buy influence.

KURT VOLKER [00:50:23.473 - 00:50:45.187]: To me, they are very different things and as I said, I think the former is unacceptable. I think the latter in this case is understood, but you understood the relationship between Hunter Biden and bereavement. I knew that he had been a board member of the company. Yes, let's go back. That's why was so important to maintain a distinction.

KURT VOLKER [00:50:45.187 - 00:51:06.900]: Let's focus on the July 25th call for a moment.

UNIDENTIFIED [00:51:07.750 - 00:51:20.020]: Mr. Morrison July 25th was day number. What for you as the senior director overseeing Ukraine officially took over on the 15th?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:51:20.130 - 00:51:25.150]: Approximately 10 days, very few days actually in the office.

UNIDENTIFIED [00:51:25.290 - 00:51:40.265]: You testified in your deposition that you received an e-mail on the morning of July 25th from Ambassador Sunland shortly before the call. Is that right? Yes. And I believe in that e-mail ambassador, Sunland told you that he had briefed President Trump about in advance of the call. Is that right? Yes. And I believe you also testified that Ambassador Sunland had told you on another occasion that he could call the President whenever he wanted.

UNIDENTIFIED [00:51:40.265 - 00:51:55.240]: Is that right?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:51:57.300 - 00:51:58.420]: Yes.

KURT VOLKER [00:51:58.570 - 00:52:09.700]: And on July 25th, did you in fact make an effort to confirm whether or not the phone call between Ambassador Sunland and President Trump actually occurred?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:52:09.700 - 00:52:12.130]: I did and did it -- did it happen?

UNIDENTIFIED [00:52:12.130 - 00:52:31.100]: Yes, on other occasions when Ambassador Sunland told you that he spoke with President Trump, did you on some other occasions, did you also seek confirmation of that fact on some yes. And on those occasions, when you did seek to confirm that they had spoken, what did you find?

KURT VOLKER [00:52:31.100 - 00:52:53.870]: They had not want to pull up a text message on the morning of July 25th between -- well, this should be another one -- oh yeah, sorry, ambassador Sunlen with you, Ambassador Volker and at 754 Ambassador sung in the morning Ambassador Sunlen says, call A.S.A.P. Then at nine thirty five Ambassador, Volker you respond.

KURT VOLKER [00:52:53.870 - 00:53:16.640]: Is the screen working in front of you or just to the side, yeah, so if you could go ahead and read what you said, yes, at nine thirty five, yes, so I said -- Hi, Gordon. Got your message had a great lunch with Yarmouk and then passed your message to him. He will see you tomorrow think everything is in place and who is Yarmouk under Yarmouk.

KURT VOLKER [00:53:16.640 - 00:53:39.410]: Is the senior adviser to President Zelinsky of Ukraine now? What was the message that you had received that President Zelinsky should be clear convincing forthright with President Trump about his commitment to fighting corruption, investigating what happened in the past, get to the bottom of things, whatever there is and if he does that President Trump was prepared To be reassured that he would say yes, come on, let's get this date for this visit scheduled.

KURT VOLKER [00:53:39.410 - 00:54:02.180]: And did you understand from that message that Ambassador Sunland had spoken to President Trump? I wasn't sure whether he had or not. He as Mr. Morrison just said, said that he does speak with President Trump. I knew that he had conversations in general. I didn't know specifically about 1 leading up to this.

KURT VOLKER [00:54:02.180 - 00:54:24.950]: Now on the screen in front of you is another text message from you that same morning, yes at eight thirty six in the morning to Andre earmark. Yes, I believe because of the time difference, this is actually in the afternoon in Ukraine, in Ukraine. And so this is East Coast time, that's right. So this is slightly less than a half hour before the call between President Trump and Presidents Alinsky.

KURT VOLKER [00:54:24.950 - 00:54:47.720]: Right and can you just read what you wrote there s and just after the lunch that I had with Andre, Jamar, good lunch, thanks heard from White House. Assuming presidency convinces Trump, he will investigate get to the bottom of what happened in 2016. We will nail down a date for a visit to Washington. Good luck.

KURT VOLKER [00:54:47.720 - 00:55:10.490]: See you tomorrow and does this accurately relay the message that you had received from Ambassador Sunlen? Yes. Now Mr. Morrison, did the National Security Council also prepare talking points for President Trump for this call, the NSC staff did yes and per usual custom. Are these -- were these talking points based on the official United States policy objectives?

KURT VOLKER [00:55:10.490 - 00:55:33.260]: They were -- and since there's been a little bit of dispute about what that means.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:55:33.260 - 00:55:53.040]: Can you explain how official U.S. policy is determined with through the interagency process we operate under what's known as NSC p.m. for National Security Presidential Memorandum for it's available on the Internet that lays out how the President wants to be provided options for his decision.

KURT VOLKER [00:55:54.440 - 00:56:07.995]: And there is an extensive process to finalize any policy is that right? Sometimes did you Mr. Morse and you you listen to this call on the 25th, is that right? I did. Where did you listen from the White House situation room in your deposition? You testified that the call was not what you were hoping to hear.

KURT VOLKER [00:56:07.995 - 00:56:21.550]: What did you mean by that?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:56:21.550 - 00:56:44.500]: I was hoping for a more, more full throated statement of support from the President concerning Presidents alone. His reform agenda, given where we were at the time with respect to the overwhelming mandate Presidents, Alinsky is servant of the party people had received in the Rada election and that Rada, which is the Ukrainian parliament.

KURT VOLKER [00:56:44.500 - 00:56:50.940]: That election had occurred four days earlier, it sounds right, and Presidents Alinsky whose party won in a landslide. Is that right?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:56:50.950 - 00:56:55.340]: They received more than a majority in their own, right.

UNIDENTIFIED [00:56:55.360 - 00:57:16.000]: So at least in Ukraine, there was tremendous support for his Alinsky anti-corruption agenda. Is that right at the time and within the inner agency within the national security agencies here in the United States, was there broad support for President Zelinsky?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:57:16.020 - 00:57:19.970]: There was broad support for giving Presidents Alinsky a chance.

KURT VOLKER [00:57:20.340 - 00:57:27.970]: And to that point, he had shown that he was -- he had at least put his money where his mouth was for the three months that he had been in office. Is that right?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:57:29.570 - 00:57:31.580]: Approximately three months, yes.

KURT VOLKER [00:57:31.580 - 00:57:45.995]: Now I want to show a couple of excerpts from this call record to each of you. The first is President Trump responding to a comment by Presidents Alinsky related to defense support from the United States and the purchase of javelins and President Trump then says I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot.

KURT VOLKER [00:57:45.995 - 00:58:00.410]: And Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine.

UNIDENTIFIED [00:58:00.500 - 00:58:06.080]: They say crowd strike, I guess you have one of your wealthy people, the server, they say Ukraine has it.

KURT VOLKER [00:58:07.090 - 00:58:36.985]: And if we could go to the next excerpt where President Trump says the other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution.

KURT VOLKER [00:58:36.985 - 00:59:06.880]: So if you can look into it, it sounds horrible to me now Mr. Morrison where these references to crowd strike the server in 2016 election and to Vice President Biden and his son were they included in the President's talking points. They were not and were they consistent with what you understood at that time to be official U.S. policy. I was not aware of any of much of this at the time. And in fact, subsequent to this call, you did nothing to implement the investigations that President Trump implement the request for the investigations that President Trump asked for. Is that right?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:59:06.880 - 00:59:10.330]: I did not understand any instruction to do so and you didn't.

KURT VOLKER [00:59:10.330 - 00:59:18.160]: You were not aware of anyone else within your -- you coordinate the interagency process and you were not aware of anyone else who was doing that either. Is that right?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:59:18.160 - 00:59:20.530]: Correct?

KURT VOLKER [00:59:20.550 - 00:59:32.220]: Now you testified in your deposition that hearing this call confirmed what you called the parallel process that your predecessor Fiona Hill had warned you about.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:59:32.220 - 00:59:53.920]: What -- what did you mean by that during the period in which Dr. Hill and I were conducting hand off meetings so that I could be up to speed on the various things that were occurring in the portfolio at the time she mentioned the traditional and SVM for Process and the parallel parallel process and in the context of discussing the parallel process, she mentioned issues like charisma which were noteworthy meet to me at the time because I had never heard of them before.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [00:59:53.920 - 01:00:15.620]: And upon hearing them in the call, it wound up confirming okay, there's something here.

KURT VOLKER [01:00:15.950 - 01:00:44.875]: And who did she inform you was involved in this parallel process? As I recall, it was definitely Ambassador Sandlin and I believe Mr. Giuliani and after she informed you of this company, Berry SMA, what if anything did you do to determine what that was after that particular handoff meeting? I proceeded to look it up on the Internet.

KURT VOLKER [01:00:44.875 - 01:01:13.800]: I googled it and did you find that it had some association with Hunter Biden? Yes. Now Ambassador Volker, you did not listen to this call, but you testified that you were surprised and troubled when you read the call record after it was released on September 25th. And you have also said that after reading the call record, it was clear to you that the Biden, charisma and the 2016 election investigations that President Trump discussed on the call were designed to serve the President's political interests, not the national interest.

UNIDENTIFIED [01:01:13.800 - 01:01:18.800]: What did you mean when you said that?

KURT VOLKER [01:01:19.250 - 01:01:54.110]: I don't recall that language from my testimony is from my October 3rd testimony. Yes, it was. Thank you. Well, what I do mean by that and I'd like to phrase it my own words now is I don't think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these -- these things I consider to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians, particularly the former Prosecutor general are sort of -- they're not things that we should be pursuing as part of our national security strategy with Ukraine.

KURT VOLKER [01:01:54.110 - 01:02:28.970]: We should be supporting Ukraine's democracy reforms, its own fight against corruption domestically, its struggle against Russia, its defense capabilities, these, these are the heart of what we should be doing and I don't think pursuing these things serves a national interest. Mr Morrison shortly after you heard the July 25th call, you testified that you alerted the NSC legal adviser. John Eisenberg pretty much right away.

UNIDENTIFIED [01:02:28.970 - 01:02:31.160]: Is that right, correct?

KURT VOLKER [01:02:31.230 - 01:02:55.920]: And you indicated in your opening statement at least from your deposition that you went to Mr. Eisenberg out of concern over the potential political fallout if the call record became public and not because you thought it was illegal. Is that right? But you would agree right that asking a foreign government to investigate a domestic political rival is inappropriate.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:02:55.930 - 01:03:05.890]: Would you not -- it's not what is all what we recommended the President discuss now in his second meeting with Mr. Eisenberg.

KURT VOLKER [01:03:05.940 - 01:03:18.470]: What did you recommend that he do to prevent the call record from leaking? I recommended we restrict access to the package. Had you ever asked the NSC legal adviser to restrict access before.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:03:18.540 - 01:03:20.290]: No.

KURT VOLKER [01:03:20.320 - 01:03:38.620]: Did you speak to your supervisor, Dr. Koppelman before you went to speak to John Eisenberg? No, Did you subsequently learn that the call record had been put in a highly classified system? I did. And what reason did Mr. Eisenberg give you for why the call record was put in the highly classified system?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:03:38.620 - 01:03:41.830]: It was a mistake. He said it was just a mistake.

KURT VOLKER [01:03:43.150 - 01:03:53.950]: It was an administrative error now isn't it also true though that you had authority to restrict access on the regular system if you wanted to?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:03:53.960 - 01:03:57.610]: I -- I believe I could have instructed the appropriate staff to do so, yes.

KURT VOLKER [01:03:57.690 - 01:04:01.110]: So why did you go to the NSC legal adviser to recommend that?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:04:01.290 - 01:04:24.865]: Well, I was also concerned that based on the participants in the listening room that day, I did not then and I do not now recall any Representatives from the NSC legal advisors office as they were often on head of state calls, but not always. And I wanted to make sure that John Eisenberg is the legal adviser and his deputy were aware to, to review this particular traNSCript and you wanted them to review it because you were concerned about the political potential political consequences, not because of it was anything was wrong.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:04:24.865 - 01:04:48.440]: Correct and political consequences, it was an umbrella term. I used in my statement to describe a series of effects. I feared about what would happen if and when the content of the transcript or the content of the memo can lead.

KURT VOLKER [01:04:48.730 - 01:05:13.410]: So just to make sure I understand this correctly, Mr Morrison you, you heard the call, you recognize that President Trump was not discussing the talking points that the NSC had prepared based on official U.S. policy and was instead talking about the investigations that Fiona Hill had warned You about -- and then you reported it immediately to the NSC legal adviser.

UNIDENTIFIED [01:05:13.420 - 01:05:58.810]: Is that the correct chain of events here? That's correct? Now Ambassador Volker in the July 25th call, President Zelinsky volunteers to President Trump that Rudy Giuliani had already spoken with one of his associates and that President Zelinsky hopes Giuliani will come to Ukraine. Then in response, President Trump proceeds to mention Mr. Giuliani on three separate occasions during this call, you testified about a May 20 third meeting in the Oval Office where the President spoke quite negatively about Ukraine and how it tried to take him down and that he also Repeated some of the allegations that Mr. Giuliani was making, is that correct?

KURT VOLKER [01:05:59.560 - 01:06:25.608]: Yes, and those allegations were in the media, were they not, yes. And during that meeting, President Trump told you and Ambassador Sunlen and Secretary Perry to talk to Giuliani. Isn't that correct? He didn't take it as an instruction. I want to be clear about that. He said that's not what I hear, you know when we were giving him our assessment about President Zelinsky and where Ukraine is headed. That's not what I hear.

KURT VOLKER [01:06:25.608 - 01:06:51.657]: I hear terrible things, he's got terrible people around him. Talk to Rudy and I understood in that context him just saying that's where he hears it from. I didn't take it as an instruction. So when he said -- talk to Rudy, you didn't take it for him to mean to -- for you to talk to Rudy. No, I didn't take it that way.

KURT VOLKER [01:06:51.657 - 01:07:17.705]: I took it as that just just part of the dialogue that I hear too, I hear other things I hear them from Rudy Giuliani or from other people. That's not what's going on. He's surrounded by terrible people. Talk to Rudy, you know, it just seemed like part of the dialogue well after that meeting, did you in fact talk to Rudy after that meeting not immediately? No, remember this was May 20 third and we continued to proceed with our effort to get the White House visit for President Lynskey scheduled and to keep ramping up our support for the new Ukrainian President and ultimately the new Ukrainian government.

KURT VOLKER [01:07:17.705 - 01:07:43.753]: I did, however on July 2nd as I was becoming concerned that we were not succeeding at this telepresence Alinsky. I think we have a problem and that problem being this negative feed of information from Mr. Giuliani. And ultimately, I think as you testified in your opening statement, you introduced Mr. Jarmon to Mr. Giuliani and they eventually met.

KURT VOLKER [01:07:43.753 - 01:08:09.802]: Is that right? That is correct now during this whole time in July and after the call into early August when they met Ukraine still desperately wanted that Oval Office meeting for Presidents Lenski correct? That is correct. And you also wanted that for Presidents Alinsky, is that right? That is correct. Why was that Oval Office meeting so important to Presidents Alinsky?

KURT VOLKER [01:08:09.802 - 01:08:35.850]: I think that he felt that he was not well understood by President Trump. He is a charismatic leader who ran a remarkable campaign in Ukraine against the legacy of corruption and political malaise that had been there yet, a massive showing in the Presidential election, 73 percent support. He believed he was leading a movement of major change in Ukraine and that President Trump was -- did not see that or didn't appreciate that.

KURT VOLKER [01:08:35.850 - 01:09:01.898]: But if he had a chance to sit down and speak with President Trump face to face, he believed that he could be very convincing about that. And I agree with him. That certainly was your assessment, right? It was my assessment and I believe it was also what President Alinsky believed and certainly that you understood from your experience in Ukraine that there would be a significant boost in legitimacy at home for Presidents Alinsky if there were photos of him in the Oval Office, et Cetera, right?

KURT VOLKER [01:09:01.898 - 01:09:27.947]: Yes, that is correct. Now you knew you testified in your -- your opening statement that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. year mark Zelinsky is a met on August 2nd. Where did they meet? They met in Madrid and what did you learn that Mr. Giuliani requested anything of the Ukrainians at that meeting only when I spoke with Mr. Giuliani afterwards. He said that he thought Ukraine should issue a statement. And then I spoke with Mr. Yarmouk after that. And he said, yes.

KURT VOLKER [01:09:27.947 - 01:09:53.995]: And we were prepared to make a statement and that then kicked off the series of discussions that I said in my testimony. We'll get into that in a second. But Mr. Giuliani did not explain to you what needed to be included in that statement. And that all you had, he said something more general as I recall, I recall him saying corrupt fight corruption that their commitment to being different. Mr. Yarmouk told me when I spoke with him, as I recall that the statement would include specific mention of Boris Mar and 2016. All right, let's go through some of the text messages. So we know exactly who said what.

KURT VOLKER [01:09:53.995 - 01:10:20.043]: And first, let's start on on August 9th, this is a text exchange between you and Ambassador Sunland where Ambassador Sunland writes at the top Morrison ready to get dates as soon as Jarmon confirms and what did you respond? I said Excellent with two exclamation points. How did you sway him with a smile afterwards?

KURT VOLKER [01:10:20.043 - 01:10:46.092]: Ambassador Sunland responded, not sure I did. I think Potosi really wants the deliverable. What did you say to that, but how does he know that? And I've asked her son says, yep, clearly lots of convos going on. Now Mr. Morris and you're referenced in this text message had you discussed confirming a date for a white house visit for Presidents or Lenski with Ambassador Sunland around this time I likely would have.

KURT VOLKER [01:10:46.092 - 01:11:12.140]: And did you have any discussions with him about a statement for that Ukraine was that they were trying to get Ukraine to make?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:11:12.150 - 01:11:14.030]: I did not.

KURT VOLKER [01:11:14.030 - 01:11:23.380]: Were you aware that you -- do you yourself know what Ambassador Sunlen meant by the deliverable?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:11:23.390 - 01:11:37.390]: I did not at the time, I think I have an understanding now and what is your understanding now? There seems to have been discussions about a statement various drafts of which have been discussed in various proceedings.

KURT VOLKER [01:11:37.880 - 01:12:03.358]: But this to your knowledge was part of that parallel process you were talking about. Yes, we can now go to the next exhibit, which is another text exchange just a few minutes later between Ambassador Sunland and new Ambassador. Volker, where Ambassador Sunland says to avoid misunderstandings might be helpful to ask Andre for a draft statement embargoed so that we can see exactly what they propose to cover.

KURT VOLKER [01:12:03.358 - 01:12:28.837]: Even though ze Zelinsky does a live presser, they can still summarize in a brief statement thoughts and how did you respond agreed. And this relates to the statement that Mr. Giuliani wanted is that right. Ambassador Volker, it relates to the statement that he and Mr. Yamanaka had discussed right now to the next day on August 10th. There's another text exchange between you and Mr. Yair Mark, who is the same aide that Mr. Giuliani had met in, in Madrid.

KURT VOLKER [01:12:28.837 - 01:12:54.315]: And if you could read what you wrote at the top at 502 p.m, Right? I wrote -- I agree with your approach that's iron out statement and use that to get date. And then President Zelinsky can go forward with it. And Mr. Yarmouk responds once we have a date, we will call for a press briefing announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of U.S. Ukraine relationship, including among other things Barry asthma and election meddling in investigations.

KURT VOLKER [01:12:54.315 - 01:13:19.793]: And what did you respond? Sounds great now the date that he's referring to that is the date for the White House visit. That's correct. Now two days later on August 12th, you receive another text message from Mr. Yarmouk, which reads, Special attention should be paid to the problem of interference in the political processes of the United States, especially with the alleged involvement of some Ukrainian politicians.

KURT VOLKER [01:13:19.793 - 01:13:45.272]: I want to declare that this is unacceptable. We intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this problem in the future. Now, ambassador Volker, this was a draft, was it not of the statement that you and Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Yarmouk and Ambassador Sunland have been discussing.

KURT VOLKER [01:13:45.272 - 01:14:10.750]: This is the first draft of that from Mr. Yarmouk after the conversations that we had.

UNIDENTIFIED [01:14:10.750 - 01:14:36.380]: And it does not mention Barry smoke or the 2016 election interference correct. And you testified in your deposition that you and Ambassador Sandlin and Mayor Giuliani had a conversation about this draft after you received it. Is that right? That is correct. And Juliette, Mr. Giuliani said that if this statement did not include Barry asthma and 2016 election, it would not have any credibility.

KURT VOLKER [01:14:36.400 - 01:14:58.892]: Is that right? That's correct. Now this was the -- the same Rudy Giuliani, that President Trump was discussing in that May 20 third meeting and asked you to talk you and the others to talk to correct. That is the same Mr. Giuliani and even at that point and may 20. Third, you were aware of these investigations that he was publicly promoting, correct?

KURT VOLKER [01:14:58.892 - 01:15:21.385]: I knew that he had adopted or was interested in all of those conspiracy theories that had come from the tanker back in May. You know, I can May now he was insisting on a public commitment from Presidents Lansky to do these investigations correct. Well, now what do we mean by these investigations, barry asthma and the 2016 election, Boris, March 2016, yes.

KURT VOLKER [01:15:21.385 - 01:15:43.877]: And at the time that you were engaged in coordinating for this statement, did you find it unusual that there was such an emphasis on a public statement from Presidents or Lenski to carry out the investigations that the President was seeking? I didn't find it that unusual. I think when you're dealing with a situation where I believe the President was highly skeptical about President Zelinsky being committed to really changing Ukraine after his entirely negative view of the country that he would want to hear something more from presence Alinsky to be convinced that okay, I'll give this guy a chance and he would perhaps he also wanted a public statement because it would lock Mr. President's Alinsky in to do these investigations that he thought might benefit him.

KURT VOLKER [01:15:43.877 - 01:16:06.369]: Well, again, we're -- when we say these investigations, what I understood us to be talking about was Ukrainian corruption. Well, I think what we're talking about is Boris mayor in the 2016 election. Let's just correct, we can agree on that. And so when we're talking about these investigations, isn't it clear that a public statement would be important to Mr. Giuliani, because it was politically useful to the President. The way I saw it is that it would be helpful.

KURT VOLKER [01:16:06.369 - 01:16:28.862]: Right, it would be a way of being convincing to Mayor Giuliani and also the President that this team in Ukraine is serious about fighting corruption reform that they are different. And if that would be helpful in getting a more positive attitude in the White House meetings scheduled, then that would be useful and that would be helpful to get that White House meeting, correct?

KURT VOLKER [01:16:28.862 - 01:16:51.354]: In fact, it was a necessary condition as you understood at that point. All right, I wouldn't have called it a necessary condition. And in fact when it became clear later that we were not able to agree on a -- an agreement that the Ukrainians were comfortable with. I agree with Ukraine is just to drop it, it's not worth it. No, I understand that.

KURT VOLKER [01:16:51.354 - 01:17:13.846]: But your -- is it your testimony that based on the text that you wrote linking the investigations and the 2016 election on July 25th to the White House meeting, you're saying that by this point in August with this back and forth that you were unaware that this public Statement was a condition for the White House meeting.

KURT VOLKER [01:17:13.846 - 01:17:36.338]: I wouldn't have called it a condition, it's a -- it's a nuance I guess, but I viewed it as very helpful. If we could get this done, it would help improve the perception that President Trump and others had and then we would get the date for a meeting. If we didn't have a statement, I wasn't giving up and thinking that, oh, well, then we'll never get a meeting.

KURT VOLKER [01:17:36.338 - 01:17:58.831]: Let's go to the next day where there was another text exchange and at the top, could you just read the first text there? It says Hi, Andre, good talking following his text with insert at the end for the two key items, we will work on official request and then you'll see the highlighted portion of the next text.

KURT VOLKER [01:17:58.831 - 01:18:21.323]: The other is identical to your previous one and then it just adds including the -- including these involving Boris and the 2016 elections. Is that right? That is correct. And that was what Mr. Giuliani insisted on adding to the statement. That's what he said, it would be necessary for that to be credible and the Ukrainians ultimately did not issue this statement as I write and it's correct.

KURT VOLKER [01:18:21.323 - 01:18:43.815]: And Presidents Alinsky ultimately did not get the Oval Office meeting either did he not yet. Now I want to move forward to September and early September when the security assistance begins to more overtly be used as leverage to pressure the Ukrainians to conduct these investigations that President Trump wanted.

KURT VOLKER [01:18:43.815 - 01:19:06.308]: Mr. Morrison you accompanied Vice President Pence to Warsaw when he met with Presidents Alinsky. Is that right? I was in Warsaw when the Vice President was designated as the President's Representative. I was accompanying Ambassador Bolton understood. You were at the bilateral meeting with the Vice President and President Zelinsky, correct?

KURT VOLKER [01:19:06.308 - 01:19:28.800]: I was in that meeting.

SEAN MALONEY [01:19:28.800 - 01:19:42.790]: Were the Ukrainians concerned about the hold on security clearance, secret clearance, military assistance rather, but yes, what did they say?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:19:42.870 - 01:20:28.640]: It was the first issue that Presidents Lewinsky raised with Vice President Pence. They were very interested. They -- they talked about its importance to Ukraine, its importance to the relationship and what was Vice President Pence's response, the Vice President represented that it was a priority for him and that we were working to address and he characterized President Trump's concerns about the state of corruption. In Ukraine and the President's prioritization of getting the Europeans to contribute more to security sector assistance.

UNIDENTIFIED [01:20:28.650 - 01:20:39.340]: And did he directly explain to the Ukrainians that those -- that those were the actual reasons for the hold or was he just commenting on general concerns of the President?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:20:40.660 - 01:20:59.900]: I don't know that he necessarily acknowledged a hold. We -- He mentioned that we were reviewing the assistance and that that's the way I heard it. That's the way I would characterize it. And those were the points he raised to help Presidents. The once we understand where we were in our process.

KURT VOLKER [01:21:00.260 - 01:21:13.850]: And to your knowledge though on sort of the staff level as the coordinator of all the interagency process, you were not aware of any review of the Ukraine security assistance money where you?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:21:14.000 - 01:21:37.160]: Well, we were -- we had been running a review, we had been running an interagency process to provide the President. The information that I had been directed to generate for the President's consideration as to the state of interagency support for continuing Ukraine security sector assistance and the entire inter-agency supported the continuation of the security assistance. Isn't that right?

KURT VOLKER [01:21:37.160 - 01:21:52.650]: That is correct. Now after this larger meeting with Vice President Pence and President Zelinsky, you testified at your deposition that you saw Ambassador Sunland immediately go over and pull Andre Yarmouk aside and have a conversation. Is that right?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:21:52.830 - 01:22:24.590]: As President Zelinsky, you have the room vice President Pence, left the room and in sort of an anteroom, ambassador, Sunland and Presidential adviser. Your Mac had this discussion. Yes, what did Ambassador Sunlen say to tell you that he told Mr. Yarmouk that the Ukrainians would have to have the prosecutor general make a statement with respect to the investigations as a condition of having the aid lifted.

KURT VOLKER [01:22:24.590 - 01:22:30.020]: And you testified that you were not comfortable with what Ambassador Sunland had told you. Why not?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:22:31.420 - 01:22:49.170]: Well, I was concerned about what I saw as essentially an additional hurdle to accomplishing what I had been directed to help accomplish, which was giving the President the information he needed to determine that the security sector assistance could go forward.

KURT VOLKER [01:22:49.190 - 01:22:52.020]: So now there's a whole other wrinkle to it, right?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:22:52.130 - 01:22:58.670]: There was the appearance of one based on what Ambassador Sonya represented and you told Ambassador Taylor about this conversation as well.

KURT VOLKER [01:22:58.670 - 01:22:59.300]: Is that right?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:22:59.320 - 01:23:03.700]: I.I. promptly reached out to Ambassador Taylor to schedule a secure phone call.

KURT VOLKER [01:23:03.890 - 01:23:17.935]: And in your deposition, you testified that his testimony other than one small distinction between President Zelinsky and the prosecutor general was accurate as to what you told him correct about that conversation. Yes, and generally speaking, you confirmed everything that Ambassador Taylor told you, except for that one thing and a small other ministerial matter relating to the location of a meeting.

KURT VOLKER [01:23:17.935 - 01:23:31.980]: Is that correct correct now, did you tell the Ambassador Bolton about this conversation as well?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:23:32.000 - 01:23:41.095]: I reached out to him as well and requested his availability for a secure phone call and what was his response when you explained to him what Ambassador Sunland had said, all the lawyers. Did you go tell the lawyers when I returned to the states? Yes. And did he explain to you why he wanted you to tell the lawyers?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:23:41.095 - 01:23:50.190]: He did not.

UNIDENTIFIED [01:23:50.190 - 01:23:59.250]: Now a few days later on September 7th, you spoke again to Ambassador Sandlin who told you that he had just gotten off the phone with President Trump.

KURT VOLKER [01:23:59.250 - 01:24:06.530]: Is that right? That sounds correct. Yes. What did Ambassador Sunlen tell you that President Trump said to him?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:24:06.840 - 01:24:19.450]: If I recall this conversation correctly, this was where Ambassador Sonya and related that there was no quid pro quo, but Presidents Wenski had to make the statement that he had to want to do it.

KURT VOLKER [01:24:23.470 - 01:24:31.120]: And by that point, did you understand that the statement related to the Biden and 2016 investigations?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:24:31.300 - 01:24:32.040]: I think I did, yes.

KURT VOLKER [01:24:33.870 - 01:24:38.660]: And that that was a essentially a condition for this security assistance to be released.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:24:38.670 - 01:24:45.060]: I understood that that's what Ambassador song on believed after speaking with President Trump. That's what he represented.

KURT VOLKER [01:24:45.920 - 01:24:51.080]: Now you testified that hearing this information gave you a sinking feeling. Why was that?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:24:51.080 - 01:25:20.320]: Well, I believe we're on September 7, the end of the fiscal year, September 30th. These are one year dollars, the duty and the departure of state funds. So we only had so much time and in fact because Congress imposed a 15 day notification requirement on the State Department funds September 7th, September 30th, that really means September 15th in order to secure a decision from the President to allow the funds to go forward.

KURT VOLKER [01:25:20.330 - 01:25:37.300]: Did you tell Ambassador Bolton about this conversation as well? I did, yes. And what did he say to you? He said to tell the lawyers why did he say to tell the lawyers. He did not explain his direction, but he's not going to -- he doesn't tell you to go tell the lawyers because you're running up on the eight day deadline, they're right.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:25:39.120 - 01:25:45.080]: Again, I don't know why he he directed that, but it seems reasonable. It's consistent with what I was going to do anyway.

KURT VOLKER [01:25:45.100 - 01:26:01.770]: And you weren't going to go tell them because of that concern, right? You were concerned about what you were hearing Ambassador Sunlen relayed to you, correct? So just so we're clear you -- you reported to concerning conversations that you had with Ambassador Sunland to the lawyers in early September in which you understood from him that the President was withholding security assistance as additional leverage to get Ukraine to publicly announce the specific political investigations. That President Trump had discussed on the July 25th call.

KURT VOLKER [01:26:01.770 - 01:26:18.440]: Is that accurate?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:26:18.710 - 01:26:23.260]: I was concerned about what Ambassador Sandlin was saying, where requirements, yes, right.

KURT VOLKER [01:26:23.270 - 01:26:38.850]: And you understood though that the investigations that Ambassador Sandlin was referring to were the two that President Trump referenced on the July 25th call, correct. By this point, yes. And during this early September time period, Mr. Morrison, did you have any conversations with Ambassador Volker about any of this?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:26:38.870 - 01:26:41.080]: I believe we had one conversation.

KURT VOLKER [01:26:41.130 - 01:26:44.820]: And what do you recall about that conversation?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:26:45.060 - 01:27:05.595]: I believe on or about September 6th, Ambassador Volker was in town to provide an update on some of his activities and that he provided that update. And then we had a one on one conversation about this, this track, the separate process and what do you recall saying to him about the separate process. I think I was interested in understanding his and his understanding of events.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:27:05.595 - 01:27:26.130]: Did you explain to him what your understanding of events was? I think I was primarily on receive mode ambassador, Volker, What do you -- do you recall this conversation?

KURT VOLKER [01:27:26.150 - 01:27:45.487]: Thank you. I do remember a conversation with him. I'm not sure about the timing I left around that time to go on a trip. And so it may have been a little bit earlier. I'm not sure about the timing and what I do remember the discussion being is Tim asking me what is my impression of the role that Ambassador song in place and my response to that was?

KURT VOLKER [01:27:45.487 - 01:28:04.823]: Well, I find it helpful that he has political contacts in the White House. I don't have those contacts. I'm working the national security, the diplomatic front, but I don't have the political contacts. And so if he's able to use those to support the same goals that we are working toward, then I view that as helpful.

KURT VOLKER [01:28:04.823 - 01:28:24.160]: Well, that's a good segue way to their next exhibit, which is a September 8th text exchange with you and Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Sunland and at the top ambassador Sunland says guys multiple convos with Z, That's Zelinsky period Pocus period, let's talk and then Ambassador Taylor about 15, 16 minutes later says Gordon and I just spoke.

KURT VOLKER [01:28:24.160 - 01:28:43.497]: I can brief you meaning you Ambassador Volker if you and Gordon don't connect approximately one hour later, ambassador Taylor says the nightmare is they give the interview and don't get the security assistance, the Russians love it and I quit. And then at the bottom about five hours later, how do you respond?

KURT VOLKER [01:28:43.497 - 01:29:02.833]: I say I'm not in the loop talk Monday, so you were not in the loop in terms of all of these conversations that Ambassador Taylor Mr Morrison Ambassador Sunland were having. Yes, that's correct. And now ultimately the hold was lifted on September 11th. Is that right? Ambassador Volker, that's my understanding.

KURT VOLKER [01:29:02.833 - 01:29:22.170]: And Mr. Morrison, were you aware that prior to September 11th that the White House that there was a whistleblower complaint circulating around the White House?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:29:22.200 - 01:29:44.370]: I don't believe so, no, but you were aware of a request to preserve records where you're not. We -- we received a number of those requests. I have a general recollection of one as our waited to Ukraine. And one final question, when was the hold lifted, as I understand it, the President gave that direction the evening of September 11th, which was two days after Congress announced an investigation.

KURT VOLKER [01:29:44.370 - 01:29:45.230]: Were you aware of that?

ADAM B. SCHIFF [01:29:45.660 - 01:30:02.770]: I believe I was familiar with the letter from the three committee chairmen yield concludes the majority 45 minutes before I turn to the minority. Are you both in your council, okay or do you need a break?

DEVIN NUNES [01:30:02.890 - 01:30:29.380]: Ranking Member Nunez who recognized for 45 minutes, well master and Mr. Morrison, I have some bad news for you. TV ratings are way down, way down. I don't -- Don't hold it personally. I don't think it's you guys or whatever drug deal the Democrats are cooking up here on the dias american people aren't buying it. I know you both answered this in your opening statements, but I just want to bring a little more clarity to it. MORRISON. I'll start start with you.

DEVIN NUNES [01:30:29.380 - 01:30:55.870]: Ah, did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at anytime during your time in the White House? No, sir and you were the top person for Ukraine in the White House, correct. At the NSC level, I would argue Ambassador Bolton would be, but reporting to Ambassador Bolton, I was a senior official yes or Ambassador Volker. You have a storied career.

DEVIN NUNES [01:30:55.870 - 01:31:22.360]: We're very thankful for your service and you were the special on boy to Ukraine. That was correct. Anyone at the White House ever asked you to bribe or extort anything out of anyone at anytime. No, sir, thank you. I want to thank you both for being here and I'll yield to Mr. Castro.

KURT VOLKER [01:31:22.990 - 01:31:47.886]: Thank you, Mr. Ness. Thank you both for being here today and also for participating in the lengthy depositions, ambassador Volker. You were the first one on October 3rd and Mr. Morrison you were with us on Halloween. So thank you for your participation. Mr. Morrison also, I want to thank you you a longtime Hill staffer.

KURT VOLKER [01:31:47.886 - 01:32:12.781]: I certainly have appreciation for that on nearly 20 years. Thank you. And Ambassador, Volker Hatteberg, Pennsylvania resident, absolutely not a credible part of the country, very proud of it. And from nearby want to walk through some of your positions. You were a Senate confirmed ambassador to NATO. That is correct.

KURT VOLKER [01:32:12.781 - 01:32:37.677]: And then you were at the State Department and your portfolio spanned much of what I believe George Kent has currently. I was the principal deputy assistant secretary. So I had all working for the assistant secretary had all of Europe and Eurasia and particular responsibility for NATO, Western Europe, European Union and then you -- you're involved with the National Security Council you had and you were the director for NATO and Western Europe.

KURT VOLKER [01:32:37.677 - 01:33:02.573]: That is correct. And then you were the senior director for four European and your Asian affairs. I was acting for several months, six months or so, okay. I didn't much like him job Mr. Morrison. I had and we'll note that all the witnesses that we have interacted with have just heaped praise on you. Ambassador. You advantage said you are a brilliant diplomat.

KURT VOLKER [01:33:02.573 - 01:33:27.468]: So that's very high praise and for over two years you served as the special Representative for Ukraine negotiations. That is correct and you served for free. That is correct. You served on a voluntary basis, I did and you put a lot of time and effort into that job, didn't you? Yes, I did the taxpayers got there, certainly got their money's worth, didn't they?

KURT VOLKER [01:33:27.468 - 01:33:52.364]: Not for me to say and you believe America's policy towards Ukraine has been strengthened during your tenure as the special Representative. Absolutely. When I look back at the record, I think we -- we did an awful lot to support Ukraine. Is it fair to say that's in part due to President Trump, President Trump approved each of the decisions made along the way, providing lethal lethal defensive equipment and the non-recognition statement on Crimea?

KURT VOLKER [01:33:52.364 - 01:34:17.259]: I think being two of the most important ones and for many years there had been an initiative in the interagency to advocate for lethal defensive weaponry for Ukraine. Is that correct? That is correct. And it wasn't until President Trump and his administration came in that, that went through. That is correct. The delegation to Presidents Lenski his inauguration in May, I believe you testified. It was one of the largest delegations.

KURT VOLKER [01:34:17.259 - 01:34:42.155]: I believe it was -- I can't be a hundred percent sure, but I believe it was the largest national delegation. And included in the delegation was Secretary Perry secretary, Perry, Ambassador, Sunland, myself, Senator Ron Johnson was there and also the charg d'affaires at the U.S. embassy at the time. Joe Pennington and the talked a little bit this morning, but the President's Lewinsky's inauguration came together rather quickly.

KURT VOLKER [01:34:42.155 - 01:35:07.051]: It did, I believe we had about three days notice in which to put the delegation together. There's been some discussion about whether the Vice President was going to be able to lead that effort and as it turned out he was not able to lead it. Do you have any information as to why the Vice President was unable to join?

KURT VOLKER [01:35:07.051 - 01:35:31.946]: I don't -- And Mr. Morrison, do you have any information as to why the Vice President was unable to participate in the delegation? No Ambassador Volker you testified during your deposition. That aide in fact does get held up from time to time for a whole assortment of reasons. Is that your honor, it is true.

KURT VOLKER [01:35:31.946 - 01:35:56.842]: And sometimes the holdups are rooted in something at OMB, sometimes as at the Defense Department, sometimes just at the State Department, sometimes on the Hill, correct, that is correct. And so when the aide was held up for 55 days for Ukraine, that didn't in and of itself strike you as uncommon. No, it's something that had happened in my career in the past, I'd seen hold ups of assistance.

KURT VOLKER [01:35:56.842 - 01:36:21.738]: I just assumed it was part of the decision making process. Somebody had an objection and we had to overcome it. And in fact there were concerns that perhaps Presidents Lansky wasn't gonna be the reformer that he campaigned on. That was a supposition that I made because of the meeting with the President on May 20. I thought that could be what's behind it and in fact the aide was lifted shortly after he was able to convene a parliament. I believe he let me get the dates straight.

KURT VOLKER [01:36:21.738 - 01:36:46.633]: I believe, yes, he was able to convene the Parliament around the first of September and I believe the aide was released on the 11th of September. And when he was able to convene a Parliament, he was able to push through a number of anti-corruption initiatives that began with the Parliament seated on that day. It was a 24 hour session.

KURT VOLKER [01:36:46.633 - 01:37:11.529]: But then it continued for some time and that was an encouraging sign. It started off in a very encouraging way, yes. And other than these things going on in the background with it, the pause in the aid, the U.S. relations with Ukraine, you testified or you stated it was about as good as you'd want them to be. Can you repeat the question?

KURT VOLKER [01:37:11.529 - 01:37:36.424]: I'm sorry, you testified at your deposition that once the aid was lifted despite all the things going on in the background that U.S. Ukrainian relations were strong whereas guess what, yes, and you referenced that the security sector assistance was lifted, you know, any hold on that that There was a positive meeting in New York.

KURT VOLKER [01:37:36.424 - 01:38:01.320]: That's correct, I UNGA and there was momentum and putting pressure on the Russians. The secretary is correct. In your deposition, you made it clear that President Trump had deep rooted a negative view in Ukraine and their corruption environment. Yes, and you first became aware of his views back in September 2017.

JIM JORDAN [01:38:01.320 - 01:38:03.060]: That is correct. Tell us a little bit about that.

KURT VOLKER [01:38:03.210 - 01:38:26.830]: Yes, in September of 2017I was invited by Secretary Tillerson to do a pre brief with President Trump before his meeting with President Poroshenko on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly. I did the pre brief and then I took part in the bilateral meeting and so long before Presidents Lansky was elected, President Trump had had a negative view.

JIM JORDAN [01:38:27.160 - 01:38:36.820]: Yes, he had a very strongly negative view back in 2017. Do you remember anything he said or did that give you a feeling that he had these negative views?

KURT VOLKER [01:38:37.600 - 01:39:01.010]: Yes, I want to be very careful here because this was a bilateral meeting between the two Presidents. I don't want to stray into classified material, but I can tell you my impression was that he had a very strongly negative view of Ukraine at the time fair enough. And you described the President's skepticism at your deposition as a reasonable position, yes.

KURT VOLKER [01:39:01.010 - 01:39:24.420]: And I believe you said most people who know anything about Ukraine would would possibly think that yes and you viewed it as part of your role to help change his mind that President Zelinsky was a genuine reformer that he was not running for office for, for self Enrichment that he was indeed a good person.

UNIDENTIFIED [01:39:24.420 - 01:39:37.190]: That's correct during the May 20, 20 third meeting with President in the Oval Office.

KURT VOLKER [01:39:37.190 - 01:40:04.540]: Could you just relate to us the concerns the President articulated about the Ukraine? Yes, the President came into the meeting and immediately started speaking. He had a -- just a string of comments that Ukraine is a terrible place. They're all corrupt, they're terrible people. They tried to take me down. I tried to explain along with the others that were there. Each of us took turns speaking. I try to explain the presence. Lenski agrees with you that he was elected because of that situation in Ukraine and he has a strong mandate from the people of Ukraine to change it and that's why it's important that we actually show him very strong support now.

KURT VOLKER [01:40:04.540 - 01:40:31.890]: But the President was not convinced and he said that Zelinsky is no different that he has terrible people around him. You know, it's not what I hear about Ukraine, what we're telling him, you know, I hear that you know, nothing has changed. Talk to Rudi that that kind of dialogue as I described and when the President said that the Ukrainians tried to take him down, did you have any idea of what he was referring to? I did.

KURT VOLKER [01:40:31.890 - 01:40:59.240]: I believe that he was referring to the rumors of efforts to interfere in the 2016 election by providing damaging information about the President or about Paul Manafort to the Hillary Clinton campaign. That was one of the rumors that had been been out there and that had gotten some support from the Ukrainian prosecutor general and to the best of your knowledge, the President genuinely believed that.

KURT VOLKER [01:40:59.240 - 01:41:26.590]: Right, I believe he was concerned about it. I don't know what he actually believed, but he brought it up. And Mr. Morrison, you were also aware of the -- the President's skeptical view of foreign aid generally, yes. And that there was an initiative that he was looking at foreign aid pretty broadly, yes, in trying to scrutinize to make sure the U.S. taxpayers were getting their money's worth.

KURT VOLKER [01:41:26.590 - 01:41:53.940]: Yes, and the President was also interested, was he not in better understanding the opportunities for increased burden sharing among the Europeans, yes.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:41:54.050 - 01:42:11.080]: And what can you tell us about that? The President was concerned that the United States seemed to bear the exclusive brunt of security assistance to Ukraine. He wanted to see the Europeans step up and contribute more security assistance.

KURT VOLKER [01:42:11.370 - 01:42:21.650]: And was there any inter agency activity whether it be with the State Department or the Defense Department and coordination by the National Security Council to look into that a little bit for the President?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:42:21.660 - 01:42:35.860]: We were surveying the data to understand who was contributing what and sort of in what categories and so the President's evinced concerns.

KURT VOLKER [01:42:35.860 - 01:43:04.595]: The interagency tried to address them, yes, and by late August we just discussed with Ambassador Volker that a new Rada was seated and did that give possibly some hope that President Olinsky would be able to push through some of these reforms? Yes. And did you hope during this time period, during this 55 days where the aid was paused that potentially Zelinsky would be able to demonstrate his bond bona fides and would subsequently be able to get the President lift the aid? Yes.

KURT VOLKER [01:43:04.595 - 01:43:33.330]: In fact you traveled with Ambassador Bolton to the Ukraine right around Labor Day weekend, correct, yes, and you met with President Joe Lenski on I believe was August 20, 29.

UNIDENTIFIED [01:43:33.360 - 01:43:36.960]: Ambassador Bolton had a meeting with President Alinsky and I staff that meeting.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:43:37.170 - 01:43:48.650]: And that's right around the time when the Rada had met and they had started to push through their reforms. As I recall, the meeting, the date of the meeting between Ambassador Bolton and President, Alinsky was actually the first day of the new Rada.

KURT VOLKER [01:43:49.290 - 01:44:04.440]: And some of these reforms included naming a new prosecutor general, a new prosecutor general, a brand new cabinet, yes, and they pushed through some legislation that eliminated immunity for RADA members.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:44:04.440 - 01:44:06.700]: Yes, eliminating a parliamentary immunity.

JIM JORDAN [01:44:06.880 - 01:44:19.420]: And I believe you -- you provided some color into this experience this meeting and you said that the Ukrainians had been up all night working on some of these legislative initiatives.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:44:19.840 - 01:44:29.030]: Yes, the -- the Ukrainians within we met were by all appearances exhausted from the pace of activity and was ambassador Bolton encouraged by the activity.

JIM JORDAN [01:44:29.260 - 01:44:38.370]: Yes, he was and was the meeting altogether favorable quite and at that point time after the meeting.

UNIDENTIFIED [01:44:38.390 - 01:44:46.120]: Ambassador Bolton, did he head off to Warsaw with the Vice President or did he just -- I know you went to Warsaw.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:44:47.140 - 01:45:01.240]: Well, we -- we had a few stops between Ukraine and Poland, but yes, Ambassador Bolton proceeded to Warsaw where we were expecting to ensure everything was staged properly for the President's arrival.

KURT VOLKER [01:45:01.340 - 01:45:06.150]: And did you have an opportunity to brief the Vice President, I did not.

UNIDENTIFIED [01:45:06.230 - 01:45:13.090]: Did Ambassador Bolton he did and what do you remember from what Ambassador Bolton shared with the Vice President about Zelinsky meeting?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:45:14.620 - 01:45:33.930]: So I was not there. The issue I remember most starkly was Ambassador Bolton was quite annoyed that Ambassador, someone crashed the previous day, but the ambassador had everything he needed to ensure that the either the President or the Vice President were well-prepared.

KURT VOLKER [01:45:34.530 - 01:45:47.770]: But did you brief Ambassador Bolton before he had an opportunity to meet with the Vice President? I didn't need to. I was Ambassador Bolton. Was there? okay. But as far as you know, Ambassador Bolton communicated to the Vice President that the goings on in Ukraine were positive. That's my understanding with President Polansky.

KURT VOLKER [01:45:47.770 - 01:46:01.010]: And at this time, Ambassador Bolton was advocating for the lifting of the aid he had been for some time, yes.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:46:03.750 - 01:46:20.500]: And did you participate in the worst hall meetings, we had a reduced schedule from what had been arranged for the President for the Vice President, but the Vice President met with President Duda of Poland. And he met with Presidents once he and I participated in both meetings.

KURT VOLKER [01:46:20.620 - 01:46:34.030]: And what do you remember from the meeting with President Zelinsky, it seemed very -- it seemed very positive. What was the message? I mean President Lynskey, he rate raised the issue of the aid, correct, yes. And how did the Vice President respond?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:46:34.330 - 01:46:57.480]: He represented his support for the aid. He represented the strong commitment of the United States to Ukraine and he explained that President Trump, because this is after the Politico article had come out that that made clear there was a hold. He explained that what we were doing was the United States government.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:46:57.480 - 01:47:20.630]: The interagency was examining what more Europe could do in the security space and taking a look at how Ukraine was reforming, what -- what had has been a history of corruption. And was there any discussion during the meeting with Presidents Lenski on the part of ice, the Vice President about any of these investigations we've come to talk about?

JIM JORDAN [01:47:20.690 - 01:47:33.830]: No, So charisma wasn't raised, no. 2016 election wasn't raised, no. And the Vice President didn't mention any investigations at all. Did he?

UNIDENTIFIED [01:47:33.830 - 01:47:58.610]: No, you mentioned the August 28 Politico article. Was that the first time that you believe the Ukrainians may have had a real sense that the aid was on hold? Yes. So from the 55 day period spanning July 18th through September 11th, it didn't really become public until August 28.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:48:00.020 - 01:48:10.495]: That's correct. Ambassador, Taylor and I's had a number of phone calls where we in fact talked about do the Ukrainians know yet because we both felt very strongly. It was important that we ensure that the President was able to make the decision to release the aid before the Ukrainians ever found out about it. Okay?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [01:48:10.495 - 01:48:20.970]: And Ambassador Volker is that -- is that also your -- your recollection? Yes, it is.

KURT VOLKER [01:48:20.990 - 01:48:31.770]: It wasn't until the Politico article that, that's correct. I received a text message from one of my Ukrainian counterparts on August 20, 9th forwarding that article and that's the first they raised it with me.

UNIDENTIFIED [01:48:31.770 - 01:48:39.060]: And can you share a little bit with us about your communications during that time period about the holding the aide?

KURT VOLKER [01:48:39.080 - 01:49:03.956]: Yes, I didn't have any communications with the Ukrainians about the hold on aid until after they raised it with me for the same reason that Tim just gave. The hope that we could get it taken care of ourselves before it became something that they became aware of inside the U.S. government. I was aware that the hold was placed.

KURT VOLKER [01:49:03.956 - 01:49:28.833]: I was aware of that on July 18th, it was referenced dead, that an agency meeting and I got a readout from that meeting from one of my assistants. I then immediately spoke with several people when the administration to object. I thought that this was a bad decision or a bad hold, maybe not a decision, but you know a process.

KURT VOLKER [01:49:28.833 - 01:49:53.709]: And I wanted to make sure with all the arguments were marshaled to get it lifted. And so I spoke with the Pentagon lawyer cooper, I spoke with Assistant Secretary of Paul M. affairs at the State Department who is going to represent the State Department at the next higher level meeting. I believe I spoke with officials in European bureau with the National Security Council staff.

KURT VOLKER [01:49:53.709 - 01:50:18.585]: So I was actively trying to convey that this needed to be lifted and I wanted them to be able to use my name in doing so because I felt that the best prospect for positioning ourselves for negotiations with Russia is the strongest defense capability for Ukraine. And during this time period, did you come to believe that any of these investigations were part of the hold up in the aid?

KURT VOLKER [01:50:18.585 - 01:50:43.461]: No, I did not backtrack just a little bit on July 3rd, you met in Tirana with President Zelinsky and there's been some, you know, ambassador Taylor and Mr. Kant provided some testimony that they had some apprehension that that part of this year, irregular channel that Ambassador Taylor Referenced would rear its head in Toronto.

KURT VOLKER [01:50:43.461 - 01:51:08.338]: I'm just wondering if you can tell us whether that in fact happened. Yes, thank you. I can only tell you what, what I know there may have been other conversations or other things. But I know that we had a conversation Bill Taylor and I believe Gordon's on online and I around the twenty eighth of June that later connected to a believe a conversation with presence Lynskey, although I may not have been part of the latter.

KURT VOLKER [01:51:08.338 - 01:51:33.214]: That being said, I was convinced after that conversation we had gotten nowhere. We had our White House briefing of President Trump on May 20 3rd. He signed a letter inviting President Olinsky to the White House on May twenty ninth and for several weeks we were just temporizing with the Ukrainians saying well, we're working on it. It's a scheduling issue.

KURT VOLKER [01:51:33.214 - 01:51:58.090]: You know, we'll get there, don't worry and I told Bill and Gordon that I was gonna see President Zelinsky in Toronto and I feel an obligation to tell him the truth that we have a problem here. We're not getting a date scheduled. Here's what I think the problem is, it's the negative information flow from Mayor Giuliani and that he would also -- that I would advise him that he should call President Trump personally because he needed to renew that personal relationship and be able to convey to President Trump that He was serious about fighting corruption investigating things that happened in the past and so forth.

KURT VOLKER [01:51:58.090 - 01:52:22.966]: So I -- I did all of that with presence Lewinsky in a pull aside after our formal bilateral meeting and during that meeting in Toronto where the series of meetings, there was no discussion of preconditions investigations of anything. No, yes or no. And you were there with Mr. Kent. Yes, I believe so. And did you ever have any discussions with him about preconditions or investigations?

KURT VOLKER [01:52:22.966 - 01:52:47.843]: Not at that time, I think later on these things came up about when we were talking about a statement whether there were investigations. But I believe at this time in Toronto, it was really more you referring to investigations generically that that is how you go about fighting corruption. And that President Zelinsky should reaffirmed his commitment to President Trump in a direct phone call.

KURT VOLKER [01:52:47.843 - 01:53:12.719]: OK, and at any point time did you had Mr. Kent raised any concerns to you about any of this not at that time? Next event I want to cover is the July 10th meeting in Ambassador Bolton's office talked a little bit about this morning. I don't know if you caught the coverage, but there was a testimony that at some point Ambassador, someone mentioned investigations and reportedly that the meeting ended abruptly.

KURT VOLKER [01:53:12.719 - 01:53:37.595]: What can you tell us about that fact? Thank you. Yeah. And let me answer that question first. I'd like to come back to your prior question for a second too, if I may. But on the July 10th meeting, this was a meeting that we had arranged between Alex Emilio, who is the head of the National Security and Defense Council and National Security Advisor. Bolton attending the meeting was also Secretary Perry.

KURT VOLKER [01:53:37.595 - 01:54:02.471]: Ambassador Sunland myself, I believe Fiona Hill and also Andre Yarmouk. The purpose was really a counterpart visit. I thought that this would be the best opportunity is the first high level meeting that we were having in Washington with a senior U.S. official ambassador Bolton after President Lewinsky's inauguration. I thought to be a great opportunity for the Ukrainians to make their case.

KURT VOLKER [01:54:02.471 - 01:54:27.348]: They are the new team in town, real deal about fighting corruption. I was rather disappointed with the meeting as it transpired. It struck me as down in the weeds talking about reform of national security structures in Ukraine, legislation that they were working on and not the big picture and not the bilateral relationship.

KURT VOLKER [01:54:27.348 - 01:54:52.224]: So it's a bit disappointed by that. And at the end of the meeting, I do recall having seen some of the other testimony that I believe in Basra ambassador and did raise the point of investigations in a generic way. This was after the meeting was already wrapping up and I think all of us thought it was inappropriate and the conversation did not pick up from there. It was.

KURT VOLKER [01:54:52.224 - 01:55:17.100]: The meeting was over, we all went outside and we had a picture taken in front of the White House and then all of us except Ambassador Bolton went down to the wardroom to talk through a follow up about well, how do we follow up on this meeting To keep the momentum in the relationship and I think we broke up into several small groups.

KURT VOLKER [01:55:17.100 - 01:55:41.976]: I remember having a conversation with Secretary Perry and one of his assistants about energy reform as part of that, I don't recall other conversations following up on investigations over Reshma and the best of your knowledge there certainly was no precondition discussed, right? No, no. Again, the issue of the security assistance was one where I thought that this was really related to a -- a general negative view about Ukraine.

KURT VOLKER [01:55:41.976 - 01:56:06.853]: There was nothing specific ever communicated to me about it or the reasons why it was held and we certainly didn't want to talk about it with the Ukrainians. We wanted to fix it, okay. And then a couple weeks later, the July 25th call happened and you were headed to Ukraine during that time period. Yes, I was actually already on my way to Ukraine.

KURT VOLKER [01:56:06.853 - 01:56:31.729]: I think two days prior to that and you received readouts both from the U.S. side and the Ukrainian side. Could you tell us about that? Yes, so I was not on the phone call. I had arrived in Ukraine and I had had that lunch with Mr. Yarmouk that we saw on the day of the phone call. I had been pushing for the phone call because I thought it was important to renew the personal connection between the two leaders and to congratulate President Zelinsky on the parliamentary election.

KURT VOLKER [01:56:31.729 - 01:56:56.605]: The readout that I received from Mr. Yarmouk and then also from the U.S. side, although I'm not exactly sure who it was from on the U.S. side, but there was a U.S. and a Ukrainian readout were largely the same that it was a good call. It was a congratulatory phone call for the President win in the parliamentary election presence.

KURT VOLKER [01:56:56.605 - 01:57:21.481]: He did reiterate his commitment to reform and fighting corruption in Ukraine and President Trump did reiterate his invitation to President Linsky to come visit and visit him in the White House. It's exactly what I thought the phone call would be. So I was not surprised at getting that as the readout and did you ever have any discussions with Ambassador Taylor about this at that time?

KURT VOLKER [01:57:21.481 - 01:57:46.358]: We were together in Ukraine at that time. We went the very next day to visit the conflict zone and I'm sure he heard the same readout that I did and you had a meeting with President Zelinsky on the twenty sixth. Yes, we had a meeting the day after the phone call and the 26 in the morning before heading out to the conflicts where any of these concerning elements that some witnesses have raised about the call raised in the meeting with President Selenski.

KURT VOLKER [01:57:46.358 - 01:58:11.234]: No Only the very bare bones read out that I had received that was also how it was discussed in the meeting with President Zelinsky. So to the extent there's been assertions that President Joe Lenski was concerned about demands President Trump had made. I don't recall that you don't recall that I do not recall him.

KURT VOLKER [01:58:11.234 - 01:58:36.110]: I don't recall -- well, let me turn that around and say he was very positive about the phone call. okay. I don't recall him saying anything about demands, but he was very upbeat about the fact of the call and there was no discussion on the part of Presidents Lansky on how to navigate the various. I don't recall the concerns that people have articulated about the call.

JIM JORDAN [01:58:36.590 - 01:59:04.430]: I don't remember that and Mr. Zeldin asked you in the deposition that it in no way shape or form in either readouts from the United States or Ukraine. Did you receive any indication whatsoever or anything that resembled a quid pro quo? Is that correct? That's correct. And the same would -- would go for this new allegation of bribery.

KURT VOLKER [01:59:04.430 - 01:59:27.818]: I've only seen an allegation of bribery in the last week. It's the same common set of facts. It's just instead of quid pro quo, now it's bribery. I was never involved in anything that I considered to be bribery at all, okay or extortion or extortion. Ms Castro, may I May I address two specific points source.

KURT VOLKER [01:59:27.818 - 01:59:51.206]: One is I'm reminded that the meeting with Ambassador Bolton and Mr. Dinardo took place on July 10th and I did not become aware of the hold on security assistance until July 18th. That is another reason why that did not come out. okay. And at that point in time, you didn't know that the potential pause in this security assistance was -- was brewing.

KURT VOLKER [01:59:51.206 - 02:00:14.593]: I did not know. I heard about it for the first time on the 18th. okay. May I make a second observation? Absolutely. I do remember having seen some of the testimony of Mr. Kent, a conversation in which he had asked me about the conspiracy theories that were out there in Ukraine, I don't remember what the date of this conversation was.

KURT VOLKER [02:00:14.593 - 02:00:37.981]: And my view was, well, if there are things like that, then why not investigate them chant, I don't believe that there is anything to them. If there is a 2016 election interference is what I was thinking of. We would want to know about that. But I didn't really -- there was believe there's anything there to begin with.

KURT VOLKER [02:00:37.981 - 02:01:01.369]: You testified in your deposition to the extent the Ukrainians were going to investigate other Ukrainians for wrongdoing that was perfectly appropriate and you're marked that is had it been U.S. policy for years. So if if certain Ukrainians involved with charisma company I think is the only plausible thing to look at there. As I said, I don't find it plausible or credible. The Vice President Biden would have been influenced in his duties.

KURT VOLKER [02:01:01.369 - 02:01:24.757]: But whether individual Ukrainians in this society that we know Ukraine has been for decades were trying to act in a corrupt way or to buy influence. That's possible, right? Deputy Assistant Secretary can't last Wednesday told us about, you know there was an investigation into Barry's man trying to recoup millions of dollars, taxpayer, dollars, and Ukrainians were pursuing an investigation.

KURT VOLKER [02:01:24.757 - 02:01:48.144]: There was a bribe paid, were you tracking that? I was aware of those kinds of things. I couldn't give you those kinds of details. I just know that there was a reputation around the company, okay? And subsequent to those facts and the bribe being paid, charisma company wanted to improve their image and added some folks to their board, including the President of Poland, including Hunter Biden.

KURT VOLKER [02:01:48.144 - 02:02:11.532]: Are you familiar with that? That's what I understand. And to the extent the Ukrainians, the folks affiliated with Berrimah wanted to hire those people for their board for protection purposes, so they can continue to engage in misdeeds if that was a fact worth investigating. You certainly would be supportive of Ukrainians trying to get to the bottom of that, correct?

KURT VOLKER [02:02:11.532 - 02:02:34.920]: Well, I can't speculate as to any of the specifics of what was motivating very small or not. Ukrainian government authorities investigating possible corruption by Ukrainian citizens is a perfectly appropriate thing for them to do. Mr. Morrison, I want to turn our attention back to the July 25th call. You were in the room.

UNIDENTIFIED [02:02:34.920 - 02:02:41.130]: Did anything concern you on the call?

KURT VOLKER [02:02:41.130 - 02:03:09.740]: No, And after the call ended you like Colonel Lindeman, one of your next steps was to engage the NSC lawyers and your reasons for doing that were slightly different than Colonel vestments and you articulated three, three concerns and you want to share them with us. Would you -- Would you rather I do it?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:03:09.900 - 02:03:39.880]: So I think I articulated two concerns if I'm forgetting one, please remind the two concerns I had were one, I did not see Representatives of NSC legal on the call. So I wanted to make sure that the legal adviser and his deputy were aware of the call and I was also concerned about taking steps to protect the memo on limited disclosure for fear of the consequences of it leaking.

KURT VOLKER [02:03:40.380 - 02:04:00.210]: And you were concerned about it leaking for because you were worried about how it would play out in Washington's polarized political environment, correct? Yes, and you were also worried how -- how that would lead to the bipartisan support here in Congress of towards Ukraine, right? Yes, and you were also concerned that it might affect the Ukrainians perception negatively?

KURT VOLKER [02:04:00.210 - 02:04:20.040]: Yes, and in fact all three of those things have played out, haven't they -- yes, you -- you didn't ask the lawyers to put it on the codeword system, correct?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:04:21.870 - 02:04:28.410]: I want to be precise about the Lexicon here. I did not ask for it to be moved to a compartmented system.

KURT VOLKER [02:04:28.550 - 02:04:50.400]: OK. You just wanted the transcript to be controlled, I wanted to access to be restricted. okay. And when you learned that the transcript had been stored on the compartmented server, you believe that was a mistake. Correct?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:04:50.400 - 02:05:26.130]: Well, it was represented to me that it was a mistake I was trying to pull up that mem con because we were in the process of pulling together Ambassador Bolton's materials and the President's materials for what was a planned bilat between Potosi and President Selenski. And when I went to do that, I could not pull up the package in our system. And I did not understand why I -- I spoke with the NSC executive secretariat staff ask them why and they did their research and they informed me it had been moved to the higher classification system at the direction of John Eisenberg, whom I then asked why.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:05:26.130 - 02:06:01.860]: I mean, that's -- that was the judgment he made. That's not necessarily mine to question, but I didn't understand it and he essentially told me I gave no such direction. He did his own inquiry and he represented back to me that it was -- his understanding was it was a kind of administrative error that when he also gave direction to restrict access, the executive secretary staff understood that as an apprehension that there was something in the content Of the memo that could not exist on the lower classification system.

KURT VOLKER [02:06:01.950 - 02:06:25.120]: So the best year now is there's no malicious intent in moving the transcript to the compartmented server. And to your knowledge, anybody on the NSC staff that needed access to the traNSCript for their official duties always was able to access it, correct. People that had a need to know and a need to access it once it was moved to the compartmented system.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:06:25.350 - 02:06:27.620]: Yes, okay.

KURT VOLKER [02:06:27.840 - 02:07:01.140]: The memo on of the July 25th call was in your experience prepared normally, yes, that there isn't a exact transcription of what's said on the call, correct, correct, that there's no takers in the SITUATION ROOM and then they prepare a draft and it's circulated among all relevant Parties, essentially, yes, and you had responsibility for coordinating any edits, yes.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:07:01.150 - 02:07:18.100]: We -- we look at the -- the -- the, the shorthand, we'll call it, a transcript, but the memorandum of conversation and we ensure that, that transcription is as close to accurate as possible given our requirements under the Presidential Records Act.

KURT VOLKER [02:07:18.100 - 02:07:31.975]: OK. And Colonel Inman testified that he thought it was very accurate, did you as well? I viewed it as complete and accurate. okay. Colonel them and did articulate that he he had a couple edits. He wanted charisma inserted. I think it was on page three or four in place of the company in one of the sections where President Zelinsky was talking.

KURT VOLKER [02:07:31.975 - 02:07:45.850]: You were that edit request.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:07:45.850 - 02:08:09.230]: I understand that he said in either this proceeding or the deposition that that he wanted that request, yes. okay. At the time, did you understand that he had asked for that? I don't recall that it was my practice if if it had it was if I believed in it, it accurately represented the call. I would accept it if I didn't hear it in the call. If it didn't exist in my notes, I wouldn't have made the edit okay.

KURT VOLKER [02:08:09.880 - 02:08:36.060]: Yeah, he did he just on page 4, he wanted to swap out the word company for charisma and when that edit from Colonel Dedmon was not installed. Did he give you any negative feedback that it was crucial that that edit get in the document? Not that I can recall, okay. Did he ever raise any concerns to you about the accuracy of the transcript?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:08:37.290 - 02:09:06.320]: Not that I can recall, did he ever raise any concerns to you generally about the call when we were discussing the track changes version of the memo Kahn, I believe he he, he had some concerns about the call. I believe we both agreed. We wanted that more full throated embrace of President Alinsky and his reform agenda in we didn't get it. Okay.

UNIDENTIFIED [02:09:12.060 - 02:09:29.100]: You indicated in your deposition that when you took over the portfolio for Dr. Hill July 15th, you were alerted to potential issues in Colonel Vinson's judgment, yes.

JIM JORDAN [02:09:29.120 - 02:09:34.870]: Did she relay anything specific to specifically to you why she thought that not?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:09:34.880 - 02:09:46.260]: Not as such, it was more of a overarching statement from her and her deputy who became my deputy that they had concerns about judgment.

JIM JORDAN [02:09:46.470 - 02:10:01.300]: OK. Did any other NSC personnel raise concerns with you about Mr. Benjamin? Yes, I'm sorry, Colonel them and what were some of those concerns that were brought to your attention?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:10:01.370 - 02:10:05.420]: There were -- I'm sorry, you're not.

UNIDENTIFIED [02:10:05.980 - 02:10:25.060]: We're not and we're instructed not to answer because I think that it's uh, it's beyond the scope of what you're asking for. These -- these concerns, Mr. Castor, predated any involvement with Ukrainian, his sixth sector assistance.

KURT VOLKER [02:10:25.500 - 02:10:41.293]: Well, during the deposition, I asked you Mr. Morrison, whether others raised the concern that Mr Colonel then and may have leaked information. You did ask that. Yes, yeah, and your answer was others that represented that. Yes. okay. And I asked you whether you were concerned Colonel women. Did not keep you in the loop at all times with his official duties.

KURT VOLKER [02:10:41.293 - 02:10:57.087]: Yes, and in fact, when he went to the National Security Council lawyers following the July 25th call, he did not first come to you. Is that correct, correct? And you were his supervisor in the chain of command, Correct, correct? And in hindsight, did you wish that he had come to you first before going to the lawyers?

KURT VOLKER [02:10:57.087 - 02:11:12.880]: Yes.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:11:13.410 - 02:11:35.580]: And why is that one if he had concerns about something about the content of the call, that's something I would have expect to have been notified of. I also think just as a matter of practice, since we both went to the lawyers, we didn't necessarily both need to an economy of effort may have prevailed at any point subsequently.

KURT VOLKER [02:11:35.590 - 02:11:41.990]: Did he become frustrated that he felt cut out of some some of the Ukraine portfolio? Yes.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:11:42.130 - 02:12:03.645]: And what was the nature of his concerns? While he easiest way to say it as he was concerned with respect to, for example, the Ukraine trip that he was not -- he did not go. He asked me why. It was my practice to have a number of the conversations with Ambassador Taylor, one on one and there were certain other matters. okay. And did you ever get the sense that you resolved his concerns or did they linger?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:12:03.645 - 02:12:25.160]: I explained to him my thinking and that was that okay before my time expires.

KURT VOLKER [02:12:25.180 - 02:12:53.723]: Ambassador Volker, I want to turn quickly to the -- what Ambassador Taylor describes as the irregular channel he. He was a participant with you and Ambassador Sandlin hundreds of text messages, Correct, correct. And so did he ever raise concerns about what was -- what was going on during the time period of the early August time period?

KURT VOLKER [02:12:53.723 - 02:13:22.267]: Only as you saw reflected in the text messages themselves where he said is this now a linkage or are we doing this? He had a concern about just in general, you know, Rudy Giuliani, I think all of us had. But the issue is what do you do about it about the role that he's playing. And as you note, we were in frequent contact, near daily contact throughout this entire period.

KURT VOLKER [02:13:22.267 - 02:13:50.810]: And so did -- did he ever engage you in a one on one telephone call to articulate his concerns? Not that we were on many one on one telephone calls, he did not raise those concerns that way. okay. And this, I mean you're a experienced diplomat at one point in time Senate confirmed Ambassador Simon is the ambassador to the European Union.

KURT VOLKER [02:13:50.810 - 02:14:19.353]: Secretary, Perry is a Secretary of Energy, certainly not, it doesn't sound like an irregular bunch. Did he ever articulate to you that he thought the three of you working on Ukraine policy was a problem? No, he did not. And were you surprised during his testimony when he came in for the deposition when he sort of established these two tracks that one was a regular channel that he was in charge of and the other was a yes.

KURT VOLKER [02:14:19.353 - 02:14:47.897]: I -- I don't agree with his characterization of that because I had been in my role for a couple of years. I had been the lead on U.S., Ukraine negotiations and negotiating with Russia and the inter-agency work and the work with our allies. And we have a Secretary of energy, who is a cabinet official and I think having support from the various U.S. officials for our strengthening our engagement with Ukraine, I view it as a very positive thing.

KURT VOLKER [02:14:47.897 - 02:15:16.440]: And if the concern is not us so much then because we're all U.S. officials but Mayor Giuliani, I don't view that as a channel at all because he's not representing the U.S. government. He's a private citizen. I viewed him as perhaps a useful barometer in understanding what may be helpful communication from the Ukrainian government, but not someone in a position to represent the U.S. government at all.

SEAN MALONEY [02:15:16.440 - 02:15:16.670]: OK.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:15:16.680 - 02:16:05.790]: Thank you. Okay why don't we take a five or ten minute break if I could ask the audience to allow the witnesses to leave the room. First. We are in recess but it will come to order. We're now going to proceed to a 15 minute round by either chair and majority or ranking member minority Mr. Goldman, you're recognized for 15 minutes.

KURT VOLKER [02:16:05.790 - 02:16:30.367]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, ambassador, Volker. I do want to just correct the record from the first round. You were right to point out, you asked if a quote that I represented you made in the deposition was your words and I actually read the wrong part in the quote. What you actually said was it creates a problem again where all of the things that we're trying to do to advance the bilateral relationship, strengthen our support for Ukraine, strengthen the positioning against Russia is now getting sucked into a domestic political debate in the U.S. domestic political Narrative that overshadows that?

KURT VOLKER [02:16:30.367 - 02:16:54.945]: So you were right to point that out and I apologize for the mistake. I want to go back to a couple of things that you said during the minorities round. Can you repeat again with a readout that you got of the July 25th call? Yes, I received a readout from both Ukrainian colleague, Andre Yarmouk, as well as from a U.S. person.

KURT VOLKER [02:16:54.945 - 02:17:19.522]: I don't now remember whether was my staffer or someone from the embassy or where and the readout was that it was a good phone call that it was a congratulatory phone call for the presence win in the parliamentary election. That presence Alinsky did reiterate his commitment to fighting corruption and advancing reform in Ukraine.

KURT VOLKER [02:17:19.522 - 02:17:44.099]: And that President Trump renewed his invitation for President Olinsky to come to the White House and I believe you said that that that readout was exactly as you expected the call to go. Is that right? That's what we were trying to tee up. Okay I just want to show you once again the July 25th text that you wrote to Andre Yarmouk, which was the message that you were relaying to him so that he could prepare.

KURT VOLKER [02:17:44.099 - 02:18:08.676]: President Zelinsky and you'll recall this right where you said that this was the message. Good lunch thanks heard from White House. Assuming President Z convinces Trump, he will investigate quote get to the bottom of what happened in 2016. We will nail down a date for visit to Washington. That's the -- that's what you expected from the call, right?

KURT VOLKER [02:18:08.676 - 02:18:33.254]: I expected that President Zelinsky would be convincing in his statements and comments with President Trump that he was exactly that that he would investigate get to the bottom of things that had happened in 2016. And that if he was strong and conveying who he is as a person and doing that, that President Trump would be convinced and renew the invitation to the White House.

KURT VOLKER [02:18:33.254 - 02:18:57.831]: Right, but you don't mention corruption in this text, do you get this is the word corruption not in this towards corruption is not there investigating things that have happened in the past that would be corrupt, would be investigating corruption. You say a couple of times in your opening statement, you just said it again. That is you know, investigating things that happened in the past.

KURT VOLKER [02:18:57.831 - 02:19:22.408]: You are aware of course that most investigations relate to things that happened in the past, right. Sorry, yes, okay. So that's -- that doesn't really move the needle whether it's current or past. In terms of the subject of the investigation, the investigation or things that happened in the past, you also talked a little bit about the meeting that you had on July 26 with President Zelinsky and Ambassador Sandlin in in Kiev.

KURT VOLKER [02:19:22.408 - 02:19:46.985]: Is that right, yes, on the twenty sixth meeting with President Zelinsky, yes and I believe you testified that the topic of investigations did not come up at all. Is that right? Yeah, I don't recall them coming up. Just the general phone call you did, you didn't take notes of that call at that meeting, right?

KURT VOLKER [02:19:46.985 - 02:20:11.563]: No, I did not because you had there were staffers there to do that, correct. And so if there are two staffers who have -- who took notes of that meeting and testified that the subject of either sensitive topics or investigations came up, are we better off taking their word for it than yours? I have no reason to doubt their notes. If they were notes taken contemporaneously at the meeting.

KURT VOLKER [02:20:11.563 - 02:20:36.140]: Another witness testified before us Laura Cooper about a meeting that she had with you on July on August 20th. Do you recall having that meeting with her because you didn't mention it in your desk. I did -- I did mention that I had been making the rounds to weigh in on lifting the hold on security assistance to do that with all of the inter agency players.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:20:36.870 - 02:20:51.865]: And she recalled with some specificity that meeting, which I believe was also based on her notes that you described the statement that you were trying to get President Zelinsky to make to. And I'll quote what she said, disavow interference in U.S. elections and commit to the prosecution of individuals involved in election interference.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:20:51.865 - 02:21:06.860]: And if he were to agree to do that, she testified, then you thought that it might help to lift the hold on security assistance.

KURT VOLKER [02:21:06.870 - 02:21:30.578]: Is that your recollection of the conversation as well, not exactly. And so how does yours differ? I recall talking about the statement that we had discussed earlier, the one that had been in the subject of these exchanges between Mr. Yarmouk and myself, myself, ambassador song and Rudy Giuliani and then back to Yarmouk.

KURT VOLKER [02:21:30.578 - 02:21:54.285]: So I discussed that this is an effort we are doing that this could be helpful in getting a reset of the thinking of the President, the negative view of Ukraine that he had. And if we did that, I thought that would also be helpful in unblocking whatever hole there was on security assistance, if there is this negative presumption about Ukraine getting this stuff on track would be helpful.

KURT VOLKER [02:21:54.285 - 02:22:17.993]: All right, so that's a different interpretation, but you don't doubt that what she testified is, is inaccurate. Do I believe she accurately reflected what she understood from the conversation? You testified a little bit about the June 28 conference call that you had with Ambassador, Sunland, ambassador Taylor. I'm not sure if Deputy Secretary, Ken was on the line and Secretary Perry before you looped in President Selenski.

KURT VOLKER [02:22:17.993 - 02:22:41.700]: Am I right about the participants of that or Ms Perry, secretary Perry not on it? Yeah, I am pretty sure that Deputy Assistant Secretary, Ken was not on it. I don't remember whether Secretary Perry was on it and I don't remember whether I stayed on for presence and once he joining the call or not, whether recalls -- were there any staff members or no takers on the call?

JAMES A. HIMES [02:22:41.720 - 02:22:42.770]: I don't believe so.

KURT VOLKER [02:22:42.840 - 02:23:07.140]: Why we were having a call among ourselves to talk about what were the messages we thought we needed to convey? And at that point, we've had other testimony from people who did take notes that there was a discussion about the investigations or what do you -- what you needed to do, what does President Zelinsky needed to do in order to get the White House meeting. Do you recall that I recall seeing that in Ambassador Taylor's testimony?

KURT VOLKER [02:23:07.140 - 02:23:31.440]: I believe they may have even been a text message to that effect. And again, it comes down to what are we talking about in terms of these investigations, because what I certainly understood is we're talking about Ukraine looking into and fighting corruption internally and being convincing about this and presenting the new President and the new team as a change In Ukraine?

UNIDENTIFIED [02:23:31.440 - 02:23:43.945]: Well, you understood that the investigations were Barry and the 2016 election, right, yes, and you interpreted those to be -- you would turn pretty those to be okay, because in theory they were looking into Ukrainians, correct, but we can agree. Can we not that the investigations, all the investigations that we're talking about here today were very smart in the 2016 election.

UNIDENTIFIED [02:23:43.945 - 02:23:56.450]: Correct?

DON BEYER [02:23:56.480 - 02:24:20.420]: OK. Now and what you then amended your testimony today to say is that in retrospect, if you did not realize that the purpose for Mr. Giuliani and President Trump to want the charisma investigation was to for political benefits. And in digging up dirt or or getting some information on Vice President Biden, that's what you learned subsequently, right?

KURT VOLKER [02:24:20.430 - 02:24:45.728]: It's correct that I learned about the President's interest in investigating Vice President Biden from the phone call transcript, which came much much later from Giuliani. I didn't know that he was actively pursuing this. I did know that he raised this with me directly and I had pushed back on it. Well, you knew that Ambassador Sunlen was pursuing this at the July 10th meeting when he raised these investigations himself again.

KURT VOLKER [02:24:45.728 - 02:25:11.025]: He didn't specify bIDEN, He didn't specify a reason as I recall either I understood it to be a generic comment and something again not appropriate for that meeting, right? I understand. But Bob Biden wasn't mentioned, but you do agree that when investigations are referenced in this context, it is more recent in the 2016 election.

KURT VOLKER [02:25:11.025 - 02:25:36.323]: No, Yes, that's what I understand, right. And on that July 10th call, when Ambassador Sunlen raised the investigations, he did that in response to a question from the Ukrainians about the White House meeting, isn't that right? Can you repeat the question? I didn't catch them whining about you said that Ambassador Sunlen mentioned specific investigations at the July 10th meeting and Ambassador Bolton's office.

KURT VOLKER [02:25:36.323 - 02:26:01.620]: And you said that you thought that was inappropriate. Yes, didn't he make that comment in response to a question from the Ukrainian officials about when they could schedule the White House meeting that I'm not sure about. I remember the meeting essentially already being over and then Ambassador. Someone bringing that up and in the July second or third meeting in Toronto that you had with President Zelinsky, you also mentioned investigations to him.

UNIDENTIFIED [02:26:01.620 - 02:26:15.290]: Right and again you were referring to them, yes, I was thinking 26 spend 2016 And you understood that that's what the Ukrainians interpreted references to investigations to be related to bury asthma in the 2016 election.

KURT VOLKER [02:26:15.330 - 02:26:41.490]: I don't know specifically that time if we had talked to that specifically Brisbane 2016 with presidency that was my assumption though that they would have been thinking that too. Now Mr. Morrison, What did you have that conversation with Fiona Hill about Barry asthma and the parallel track involving ambassador, a parallel process rather involving Ambassador Sunland and Rudy Giuliani.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:26:41.490 - 02:26:48.160]: Do you recall we had a number of handoff discussions between 1 July and 15 July?

KURT VOLKER [02:26:48.760 - 02:27:04.500]: So in -- in that period of time, you were certainly aware of this effort to promote this Paris, the investigation that Ambassador Sunland and Rudy Giuliani were -- were going about or at least you had heard about it from Dr. Hill.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:27:04.500 - 02:27:34.815]: I had heard about it. Dr. Hill. okay. I want to pull up another excerpt from a recent Wall Street Journal article that quotes an email on from July 13th that Ambassador Sunland sent to you. And he wrote to you quote. Sole purpose is for Zelinsky to give Potosi assurances of new sheriff in town corruption and corruption. Ending unbundling moving forward and any hampered investigations will be allowed to move forward transparently.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:27:34.815 - 02:28:05.130]: And you responded tracking what did you understand? Ambassador Sunland to mean when he wrote to you any hampered investigations will be allowed to move forward transparently? I don't know that I had any understanding. These are emails from 13 e-mails. I wasn't even in the seat yet. I knew that among the head of state meetings we were attempting to schedule was one between the President and Presidents once.

KURT VOLKER [02:28:05.470 - 02:28:24.670]: Right, but it was before this that Dr. Hill had told you about charisma and Ambassador Sunland in particular his desire for this parallel process to investigate charisma, right? Yes, so you had that association when you received his email asking you about investigations, correct?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:28:24.670 - 02:28:54.085]: Not necessarily, no, No. Why not because an ambassador, but among the discussions I had with Dr. Hill were about Ambassador Sanborn. I think she might have pointed the Gordon problem and I decided to keep track of what Ambassador Solomon was doing. I didn't necessarily always act on things Gordon suggested that he believes were important, so he wanted to get a meeting. I understood that the President wanted to do and had agreed to a meeting.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:28:54.085 - 02:29:23.500]: And so I was working, I was tracking that we needed to schedule a meeting. You were not endorsing the notion of President Zelinsky sending a message about investigations. Is that your testimony that that is my testimony ambassador Volker, I want to jump ahead.

KURT VOLKER [02:29:25.290 - 02:29:48.312]: After the aide was released, you went to the yes conference right in, in Ukraine and you are you aware that Ambassador Taylor who testified based on quite detailed notes indicated that earlier a few days before that Ambassador Sunland had told him that President Trump is a businessman. And so before he writes a check, he likes to see people pay up something to that effect.

KURT VOLKER [02:29:48.312 - 02:30:11.334]: Are you're aware of that? I am familiar with that testimony and you're also familiar that Ambassador Taylor said that you said something very similar to him when you were in Ukraine for the U.S. Conference. Do you recall saying that? So ambassador, yes, I do. I was repeating what Gordon's online had said to me to explain to Bill Taylor what that understanding was and in what context did Ambassador Sunlen say that to you?

KURT VOLKER [02:30:11.334 - 02:30:34.356]: I think we were talking about the release of the hold on security assistance and he was saying that the President has -- he sees he's already got a negative view of Ukraine. He sees a check on his desk that's going to the Ukrainians, not sure about them. So he wants to hold onto it until he's assured, right.

KURT VOLKER [02:30:34.356 - 02:30:57.378]: And the pay up before he writes the check is to get the investigations that he wants, isn't that right? That was not clear to me. What did you think it meant? I didn't think that there was a pay up as you said. As we said, the language was similar. I had heard from Gordon that he sees this check. He's not sure he wants it. He wants to make sure that he's got to deal with the Ukrainians.

KURT VOLKER [02:30:57.378 - 02:31:20.400]: I didn't know specifically other than this the generic formulation, Mr. Chairman, I yield back 15 minutes to ranking member known as parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chair.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:31:20.590 - 02:31:34.990]: Do you expect any more of these magical 15 minute of devotions that you come up with in the back magical they are -- they're prescribed by House Resolution 660 that we can have successive rounds of up to 45 minutes. So this is part of the prescribed procedure under the House resolution. Do you expect you're going to have more this evening, are you?

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:31:34.990 - 02:31:49.390]: I do not -- I do not expect more will be necessary. Thank the gentleman.

DEVIN NUNES [02:31:49.390 - 02:32:14.038]: So for everyone watching, this is another example of how out of control this process has become where the Democrats just magically give themselves additional minutes, which the right and a little special rule that they wrote, they can do. But you'd at least think that they'd have the decency to just tell us that you're going to have 15 minutes more. And I would say that you can go four hours, we can go five hours, we'll give you all you want.

DEVIN NUNES [02:32:14.038 - 02:32:38.685]: You can keep digging if you want the deeper the hole you dig, the more viewers will turn off because people just aren't buying the drug deal that you guys are trying to sell. I would add that since we are getting into primetime, these are two witnesses that were your witnesses that you called in to depose the.

DEVIN NUNES [02:32:38.685 - 02:33:03.333]: We still ask for witnesses that you did not depose, including the whistleblower who you and others claim, not to know which we still need to get to bottom of that because it is the most important material fact witness to how this whole mess began in the first Place secondly, we've asked for the DNC operatives that were working with the Ukrainians to dig up dirt for what you call or what the left calls conspiracy theories which they are right. There are conspiracy theories of dirt that they dug up to spin their own conspiracy theories to attack the Trump campaign in the 2016 election.

DEVIN NUNES [02:33:03.333 - 02:33:27.980]: So I have no more questions for these witnesses. I know our members do. Mr. Castro, you have a little bit of cleanup here.

KURT VOLKER [02:33:27.980 - 02:33:51.198]: Thank you, Mr. Nunez. I'll try to be quick and yield some time back. So we don't have to use every last minute ambassador Volker you aware of a statement just last week from Foreign Minister POLITICO about the he said that no one ever told the Ukrainians certainly not him that there was any linkage between the security assistance funds and investigations.

KURT VOLKER [02:33:51.198 - 02:34:14.416]: I saw that statement, yes. And do you know the foreign minister I do and during times relevant, Did you ever have any discussions with him about investigations and links not about investigations with him? I believe I kept that discussion to being with Mr. Jarmon and we did discuss with Foreign Minister of State.

KURT VOLKER [02:34:14.416 - 02:34:37.634]: And at the time his diplomatic advisor security assistance after it was raised after August 29, And I did discuss that with him. The primary person you worked with was Mr. Yarmouk. Yes. And Mr. Yarmouk also had some meetings with Ambassador Sandlin. Did he ever give -- did Mr. Yarmouk ever give you any feedback from his interactions with Ambassador Sunland?

KURT VOLKER [02:34:37.634 - 02:35:00.852]: I can't say whether he did or didn't. We were in frequent contact and we were just talking about the issues as as we went along the episode at Warsaw where apparently Ambassador Sunland pulled. Mr. Yarmouk aside, did -- did he give you the Mr. Yarmouk give you a -- a any feedback on that meeting? I did not get anything specific after that.

KURT VOLKER [02:35:00.852 - 02:35:24.070]: This was around, I believe September 1st or 2nd and it was at that time that I had been, I think texted by Mr. Yarmouk and the subsequent in touch with him and first Ica where I told them both and also the defense minister. I told them all, don't worry, we know about this, we're trying to fix it and I think I left the conversation at that and those Ukrainian officials, the best of your knowledge, they trusted you very much. So we had a very close relationship.

KURT VOLKER [02:35:24.070 - 02:35:47.288]: And so when you made statements like that to them, do you think they believed you? I think they believe me, I think they would also have other conversations and they would hear things from other people. But I also think that they knew I was sincere with them and they also trusted Ambassador Taylor. Yes, I just like to demystify a little bit of the whole Mayor Giuliani role here. You met with him, I believe, one time.

KURT VOLKER [02:35:47.288 - 02:36:10.506]: That's correct. And you had some -- you exchanged some text messages with him, correct? Yes, between, I guess, was the 10th of July and the uh around the 13th of August. And during your deposition, we sort of did an accounting of your communications with Mr. Giuliani. And it wasn't that there weren't that many, we sort of accounted for them all.

KURT VOLKER [02:36:10.506 - 02:36:33.724]: And then Ambassador Simon, when he came in, he he didn't have -- you know, he didn't have any one on one meetings with Mayor Giuliani to your knowledge. Is that correct? I don't believe he did, but I don't know. And in fact, I think Ambassador Sandlin testified that there were a couple of conference calls that that you know he may have been on with you.

KURT VOLKER [02:36:33.724 - 02:36:56.942]: That is true. Okay The -- just getting back to the regular channel that Ambassador Taylor coined in his deposition testimony, did you ever have an opportunity to sort of close the loop with him about any concerns whatsoever or was it all just these specific instances raised in the text? It's only those specific instances.

KURT VOLKER [02:36:56.942 - 02:37:20.160]: Do you think Ambassador Taylor and your communications with him believe that Mr. Giuliani was in far greater communication with yourself, Secretary Perry and Ambassador Sandlin? I don't know what he thought. okay. That's all I have, Mr. Dean.

UNIDENTIFIED [02:37:20.160 - 02:37:40.550]: As Dean I have nothing more would the gentleman allow us to use our magic minutes to yield to one of our members who'd like to go house rules don't permit that. Mr. Dennis yield back will now go to five minute member questions, recognize myself for five minutes.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:37:42.000 - 02:38:00.563]: Mr. Volcker, I want to ask you about something in your opening statement with respect to the July 10th meeting. You testify I participated in the July 10 meeting between national secret advisor Bolton and then Ukrainian chairman of the National Security Defense Council, Alex down there. As I remember, the meeting was essentially over when Ambassador, someone made a generic comment about investigations.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:38:00.563 - 02:38:19.127]: I think all of us thought it was inappropriate. The conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded, Mr. Volker, we asked about that meeting during your deposition and you told us nothing about this. I believe we asked you about why the meeting came to an end and why you had earlier indicated, I think Ambassador Taylor that it did not go well and your answer was that downlink was in the weeds of national security policy.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:38:19.127 - 02:38:37.690]: Why didn't you tell us about this?

KURT VOLKER [02:38:37.870 - 02:38:49.075]: Because that's what I remembered from the meeting what I -- what I provided in my October 3rd statement. As I said, I learned other things, including seeing the statements from Alex Feynman and from Fiona Hill and that reminded me that yes, at the very end of that meeting as it was recounted in Colonel Lindeman statement, I did remember that.

KURT VOLKER [02:38:49.075 - 02:39:00.280]: Yes, that's right.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:39:00.280 - 02:39:15.350]: Gordon did bring that up and that was it. So at the time we depose you and I think we were there for six, seven or eight hours and we were asking you specifically about what you knew about these investigations. You didn't remember that Gordon Sunland had brought this up in the July 10th meeting with Ukrainians and Ambassador Bolton called an end to the meeting.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:39:15.350 - 02:39:30.420]: Ambassador Bolton described that meeting as some drug deal that saw many Mulvaney cooked up. You had no recollection of that.

KURT VOLKER [02:39:30.480 - 02:39:43.615]: Right, so in terms of Gordon bringing it up, no, I did not remember that at the time of my October 3rd testimony, I read the account by Alex and that jogged my memory is it? Yes, that's right. That did happen. I do not still to this point, I recall it being an abrupt end to the meeting. The meeting was essentially over and we got up -- we went out to the little circle in front of the White House.

KURT VOLKER [02:39:43.615 - 02:39:56.750]: We took a photograph, it did not strike me as abrupt.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:39:56.860 - 02:40:23.020]: No investor, Volker, you said in your written testimony today. I think all of us thought it was inappropriate now if as you say Ambassador Sumlin only mentioned investigations in the Bolton meeting and you don't recall hearing and be more specific, although others have testified that he was in the wardroom. Why did you think it was inappropriate?

KURT VOLKER [02:40:23.370 - 02:40:37.285]: I thought it was some -- put it this way, something of an eye roll moment where you have a meeting, you're trying to advance the substance of the bilateral relationship. We have the head of the National Security and Defense Council. It was a disappointing meeting because I don't think that the Ukrainians got as much out of that in terms of their presentation as they could have.

KURT VOLKER [02:40:37.285 - 02:40:51.200]: And then this comes up at the very end of the meetings like this is -- this is not what we should be talking.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:40:51.210 - 02:41:08.540]: But Ambassador, you've said that you think it was appropriate to ask the Ukrainians to do investigations of 2016 and Brisbane as long as Barisan didn't mean the Bidens something you have now, I think understand you should have seen otherwise, but nonetheless if it was appropriate?

KURT VOLKER [02:41:08.550 - 02:41:32.170]: Why are you saying today that all of us thought it was inappropriate because it was not the place or the time to bring up that this was a meeting between a national security adviser and the chairman of the National Security Defense Council first high level meeting. We're having between Ukraine and the United States after President Zelinsky is election is part of the reason was inappropriate.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:41:32.190 - 02:41:37.080]: Also that it was brought up in the context of trying to get the White House meeting.

KURT VOLKER [02:41:37.890 - 02:41:50.320]: Possibly, although I don't recall that being -- I know this was the counsel's question, I don't remember the exact context of when that came up. I viewed the meeting as essentially having ended.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:41:50.670 - 02:42:10.140]: I think you said in your updated testimony that you do think it's inappropriate and objectionable to seek to get a foreign government to investigate a political rival in my right to investigate the Vice President the United States or someone who is a U.S. official.

KURT VOLKER [02:42:10.350 - 02:42:16.400]: I don't think we should be asking foreign governments to do that. I would also say that's true of a political rival.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:42:16.590 - 02:42:39.020]: And and you recognized when you got the call record when you finally did see the call record, that's what took place in that call, correct? That's correct. Mr. MORRISON, Mr. Volcker thinks it's an appropriate to ask a foreign head of state to investigate a U.S. person, let alone a political rival, but you said you had no concern with that.

UNIDENTIFIED [02:42:39.020 - 02:42:43.210]: Do you think that's appropriate as a hypothetical matter? I do not.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:42:43.260 - 02:43:06.110]: Well, I'm not talking about hypothetical, Maher read the transcript in that transcript does the President, not ask Selenski to look into the Biden's? Mr. Chairman, I can only tell you what I was thinking at the time. That is not what I understood the President to be doing. But nonetheless, this was the first and only time where you went from listening to a Presidential call directly to the national security lawyer. Is it not? Yes, that's correct.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:43:06.110 - 02:43:28.960]: And I think you've said that your concern was not that it was unlawful, but that it might leak, is that right? That is correct. Now the problem with the leaking is that what would be leaking is a President asking a foreign head of state to investigate.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:43:29.470 - 02:43:43.370]: Mr. Biden isn't that the problem, I believe I stated I had sort of three concerns about what the impact of a leaking might be. Oh, it was a perfect call, would you have had a concern of leaking?

UNIDENTIFIED [02:43:43.400 - 02:43:43.920]: No.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:43:43.970 - 02:44:16.430]: Well, no, I would still have a concern about it waking would you thought it was appropriate if President Trump had asked Zelinsky to investigate John Case sic or to investigate Nancy Pelosi or to investigate Bester Volcker might be appropriate in those hypothetical cases? No, not appropriate. But you're not sure about Joe Biden, sir.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:44:16.550 - 02:44:31.200]: Again, I can always speak to what I understood at the time and why I acted the way I did at the time finally.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:44:31.400 - 02:44:47.280]: My colleagues asked about, well, it doesn't aid, get held up for all kinds of reasons. Ambassador Volker Have you ever seen military aid held up because the President wanted his rival investigated? No, I have not seen that. We've ever seen that Mr. Williams -- Mr Morrison, I'm sorry. No, German, I yield to the ranking member, so you took two additional minutes. Are you giving our side seven minutes?

ADAM B. SCHIFF [02:44:47.280 - 02:45:03.160]: Of course, I recognize Mr. Turner.

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:45:03.320 - 02:45:18.520]: Thank you. Ambassador Volker. Mr. Morrison, good to see you again. I appreciate your service to your country and your service in government. Our country is safer today because of the work of both of you men. I want you to know that during all the testimony that we've had, no one has ever alleged that either of you have done anything inappropriate or improper. And everyone has spoken of both of you as having a high level of professionalism and a high degree of ethical standards.

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:45:18.520 - 02:45:33.720]: Ambassador Volker, I appreciated in your opening statement your comments of your work to focus on Russia as an invasion of Ukraine and occupation and your work on legal defensive arms that would include the javelins. Would it not ambassador, Volker? Yes, that's right. And that made a big difference as Ukraine did not.

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:45:33.720 - 02:45:48.920]: Very big difference.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:45:48.920 - 02:46:07.880]: Mr. Mason, would you speak to tell us about your military service, Mr. Turner? I'm a U.S. Naval Reserve officer. I'm an intelligence officer and where did you go to law school george? Washington University?

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:46:07.980 - 02:46:25.916]: Gentlemen, there's been a lot of talk about a lot of people and we're going to pick up the pace here because these are like short periods of time that we have now for this portions of questions, a lot of people talking about their perceptions, their beliefs, their Feelings even what they heard and their understandings and their thoughts.

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:46:25.916 - 02:46:43.851]: Ambassador Taylor, Mr. Kent Ambassador, you've on image and Lieutenant Colonel Benderman all had conversations with each other and with other people and all had a whole bunch of hearsay. But I can assure you this boils down to just one thing. This is an impeachment inquiry concerning the President of the United States.

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:46:43.851 - 02:47:01.787]: So the only thing that matters besides all these people talking to each other and all their feelings and all of their thoughts and understandings, it really only comes down to what did the President of the United States intend and what did he say and what did the Ukrainians understand or hear ambassador Volker, you're one of the first people that we've had in these open public testimony that's had conversations with both.

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:47:01.787 - 02:47:19.723]: So I get to ask you, you had a meeting with the press United States and you believe that the policy issues that he raised concerning Ukraine were valid, correct? Yes, the President United States ever say to you that he was not going to allow aid for the United States to go to the Ukraine unless there were investigations into Barry's, Emma, the Bidens or the 2016 elections.

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:47:19.723 - 02:47:37.659]: No, he did not. Did the Ukrainians ever tell you that they understood that they would not get a meeting with the President United States a phone call with the President, United States military aid or foreign aid from the United States unless they undertook investigations of charisma. The Bidens or the 2016 elections?

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:47:37.659 - 02:47:55.594]: No, they did not, you know, pretty much Ambassador Volker you just like took apart their entire case. I mean, if the President I'd say does not believe or intended and the Ukrainians don't understand it and you're the only one who actually stands in between them now. I guess has -- and best of Volker, you know, the Three Amigo thing or whatever that that they're -- they're trying to disparage you with. You're not part of an irregular channel, right? Ambassador Volker, Aren't you the official channel?

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:47:55.594 - 02:48:13.530]: That is correct. Explain that explain how you're the official channel and not an irregular channel.

KURT VOLKER [02:48:13.540 - 02:48:29.483]: So I was appointed by the Secretary of state secretary Tillerson in July of 2017 to be the U.S. special Representative for Ukraine negotiations. That's a role that's different from Assistant Secretary of State or different from ambassador in Ukraine. That role is particularly focused on the diplomatic activities surrounding the efforts to reverse Russia's invasion and occupation of Ukraine.

KURT VOLKER [02:48:29.483 - 02:48:45.427]: It is the Minsk agreement implementation. It is the Normandy process with France and Germany. It is support from NATO. It is support for sanctions from the European Union, it's the OSCE and the monitoring missions. It is the efforts of individual allies like Poland, like the U.K., like Canada that are supporting Ukraine.

KURT VOLKER [02:48:45.427 - 02:49:01.370]: It is work at a senior level in the inner agency with secretary.

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:49:01.360 - 02:49:27.210]: Great script. I want to cut you off there. Ambassador Volker, you are also one of the few people who has actually spoken to Giuliani, the so called a regular channel. Again, all these other people had feelings that understandings about what Giuliani was doing. Did Giuliani ever tell you that United States aid or a meeting with President Red States would not occur for the Ukrainians until they agreed to an investigation of Barack Obama?

KURT VOLKER [02:49:27.460 - 02:49:33.590]: The Bidens of the 2016 election, everything I heard from Giuliani, I took to be his opinion, excellent is not.

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:49:33.820 - 02:49:56.983]: So I would assume then that the Ukrainians never told you that that Giuliani had told them that in order to get a meeting with the President a phone call with the President military aid or or a foreign aid from the United States, they would have to do These investigation no. Okay. Mr. Morrison, you testified that you spoke to Ambassador Sunland and he told you of a conversation that he had with the President United States on page 128 of his testimony.

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:49:56.983 - 02:50:20.145]: He relates the content of a conversation that he had with the President and he was asked about it. The only one he relates and he said in your come and he said, I didn't -- He was asked whether or not there was a quid pro quo. He said, I didn't frame the question basically to the President that way as a link.

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:50:20.145 - 02:50:43.308]: I did not frame the question that way I asked the open question. What do you want to see Mr. Sandlin in his testimony asking this question to the President states and this is what he reports that the President states, he said I want nothing. I don't want to give them anything. I don't want anything from them.

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:50:43.308 - 02:51:06.470]: I want Zelinsky to do the right thing. That's what he and he kept repeating. No quid pro quo over and over again. Mr. Morgan, do you have any reason to believe that Mr. Sandlin is not telling the truth as the content of his conversation with the President? And states no Congressman now do either of you have any information or evidence that anyone who has testified before this committee, either in the secret dungeon testimonies that have been released or in these open testimonies has perjured themselves or has lied to this committee.

UNIDENTIFIED [02:51:06.470 - 02:51:09.630]: No, I have no reason to think that Mr...

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:51:09.650 - 02:51:34.920]: No sir, Mr. Morrison Lieutenant Colonel Veneman reported to you, is that correct? He did sir. Now do you have a legal background? He said that he listened to the phone call phone call which you said you saw nothing that had occurred illegally and he said that he believed the prison United States demanded to President Zelinsky that these investigations move forward.

MICHAEL R. TURNER [02:51:34.920 - 02:52:00.190]: Do you believe, because he only was telling us his opinion, do you believe in your opinion that the President lied states demanded the presence of Lewinsky undertake these investigations? No, sir, both of you, Ukraine is an aspiring out to the EU. Ambassador. Sunlen is the ambassador to the EU Is the Ukraine in the ambassador's portfolio.

KURT VOLKER [02:52:00.190 - 02:52:13.690]: Ambassador Volker yes, also because the EU sanctions on Ukraine are incredibly important. Mr. Morrison, I agree sir, you back the times.

UNIDENTIFIED [02:52:13.690 - 02:52:17.660]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen for your testimony today.

JAMES A. HIMES [02:52:19.880 - 02:52:36.833]: President Trump has described his July 25th phone call with President. Zelinsky is as quote perfect and I think he's done that on Twitter, not once -- not twice, but by my count 11 times. It feels to me like this characterization of perfect is of a piece with the idea that we here in defense of the President's request to the Ukrainians.

JAMES A. HIMES [02:52:36.833 - 02:52:53.787]: That's just normal course of business pursuing anti-corruption and I've been concerned from the start that this is actually not about going after corruption. It is in fact about aiming corruption at the Vice President, Mr. Morrison. You listened in on the call in the White House Situation Room. Did you hear the President mentioned the company crowd strike and the server I believe so yes, sir.

JAMES A. HIMES [02:52:53.787 - 02:53:10.740]: Did you hear President Trump mention the Bidens? Yes, sir.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:53:10.860 - 02:53:24.740]: Did you hear President Trump in the length of that phone call, use the word corruption nose up?

JAMES A. HIMES [02:53:24.810 - 02:53:39.105]: Sir, I don't believe you, it was the request that Ukraine investigate crowd strike and the Biden's consistent with what you understood to be official U.S. policy towards combating corruption in Ukraine. Sir, it was the first I heard of much of this in fact in your deposition you testified that you wanted to stay away from what you described as this quote bucket of investigations.

JAMES A. HIMES [02:53:39.105 - 02:53:53.400]: Why did you want to stay away from those issues?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:53:53.410 - 02:53:57.730]: That was what I was advised by Dr. Hill.

JAMES A. HIMES [02:53:57.750 - 02:54:10.790]: You also testified that the President's call was not night quoting. You hear the full throated endorsement of the Ukraine reform agenda that I was hoping to hear. What did you mean by that, sir? What we?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:54:11.130 - 02:54:47.510]: Myself, Colonel Lindeman, others what we prepared in the package we provided, the President was background on Presidents, Alinsky background on his positions about reforming Ukraine and reforming its institutions rooting out corruption. We were hoping we recommended the President very clearly support what President Alinsky had run on in his own election and what his servant of the people party had run on in its election where it received a majority mandate. But that didn't come up in the call. Did it?

JAMES A. HIMES [02:54:47.520 - 02:54:55.440]: No, sir, do you -- are you aware of any other discussion in which the President actually raised those things with the -- with -- with the new Ukrainian President, corruption reform?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:54:55.560 - 02:55:09.760]: Yes, sir, it's been some time since I refresh myself on the discussion that took place at the U.N. General Assembly. So I hesitate to say, did he ever raise it, but he did not raise it at the time of the 25 July phone call.

JAMES A. HIMES [02:55:09.990 - 02:55:30.698]: OK, I'm switching gears a little bit, you strike me as a -- as a process guy and I it's nagging at me because you characterized the ambassador, Sunderland's linking in whatever way it happened of -- of -- of aid to come to an investigation. As the Gordon problem, you said it caused you to roll your eyes Ambassador Volker said it was everybody in the July 10th meeting thought it was inappropriate.

JAMES A. HIMES [02:55:30.698 - 02:55:51.407]: JOHN BOLTON characterizes this as the drug deal, so it seems like everybody in the room understands that there's a huge problem here. My understanding is that it would be normal course of business when you have an ambassador out there going rogue as apparently there was consensus Ambassador Sunland was doing that either the National Security Adviser, John Bolton or the Secretary of state might rein them in. Why didn't that happen?

JAMES A. HIMES [02:55:51.407 - 02:56:12.115]: Sir, I can't speak to that, but I would generally agree that ambassadors work for the Secretary of state and the President. Do you -- have -- you don't have any idea you worked for him, you don't have any idea why John Bolton would characterize what Ambassador, what the ambassador was doing as a drug deal, but not random it ambassadors don't work for the National Security visor, sir.

JAMES A. HIMES [02:56:12.115 - 02:56:32.823]: No, but John Bolton's, national security adviser, he presumably spends time with the Secretary of state. I'm just puzzled that everybody in the room is, you know, characterizing this as the Gordon problem or inappropriate or a drug deal and not the Secretary of state does nothing, sir. I'm sorry, was there a question?

JAMES A. HIMES [02:56:32.823 - 02:56:53.532]: Well, yeah, I just -- do you have any -- you don't have any insight into that? No, sir. And best of all, you testified that you were troubled once you read the record of the President's July 25th call. You testified quote that asking the President of Ukraine to work together with the attorney general to look into this. You can see as it now has happened.

JAMES A. HIMES [02:56:53.532 - 02:57:14.240]: This becomes explosive in our domestic politics and in your new testimony you call this unacceptable. What specifically in that call to the Ukraine President, do you find unacceptable or troubling?

K. MICHAEL CONAWAY [02:57:14.240 - 02:57:45.120]: It is the reference to Vice President Biden. Thank you. I yield back about my time. Mr. Conaway, you were chairman this morning. We heard much about what January, July 25th call in which President asked for a favor at least in Lt Colonel vineyards mind that was equivalent to a demand and order a requirement. And yet in the bad last part of the conversation between the two heads of state President Trump talks about a prosecutor, he's particularly in favor of and would like to see you stay there. And Linsky though says he's President.

K. MICHAEL CONAWAY [02:57:45.120 - 02:58:16.000]: No, Since we've won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100 percent. My person, my candidate does that to either one of you does that sound like a head of state who's been cowed or bullied and is under the thumb of the President. I said not at all. No sir. All right. The impact of the pause that occurred 50 five day pause in lethal assistance are the security assistance. None of us have really understood exactly what happened during that time frame.

K. MICHAEL CONAWAY [02:58:16.000 - 02:58:46.880]: No one knew about it other than internal U.S. folks until late August. And so the Russians would not necessarily have known about it. The potential impact and I agree with on Russia's interpretation of our support for Ukraine wasn't known until those last 14 days. But the impact on that lethal aid that they already had, should Russia had tried to move the line of contact further west with their tanks would up with the lethal assistance that we'd already given been available to them to push back on that?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [02:58:47.030 - 02:59:04.810]: Yes, it would much more sir, I agree with that. But I would also add the VA hold as I understood it, applied to Ukraine, security assistance, UAC, USA and F in math, it did not apply to F.M s and the javelins were provided under F M.S...

K. MICHAEL CONAWAY [02:59:05.050 - 02:59:22.587]: OK, So the most lethal weapon that President Trump provided to the Ukrainians that President Obama and his public part is national policy, which he said was available to them should the Russians have pushed their tanks West, the Japanese. Yes, sir, throughout that process, even with the pause, even with all the stuff that was going on, yes, sir.

K. MICHAEL CONAWAY [02:59:22.587 - 02:59:40.123]: OK. Associated Press is reporting that President and Mr. Volker, you mentioned it earlier that the Russians have an act of war, took two gunships and a tug and 24 sailors last November and yet the Russians have now given the 24 sailors back in September and the Associated Press is reporting today that the -- they're giving the -- giving the gunboats and the tug back.

K. MICHAEL CONAWAY [02:59:40.123 - 02:59:57.660]: Does that sound like a Ukraine is -- is inept at being able to go shit with the Russians because of their wounded in some way by our actions?

KURT VOLKER [02:59:57.660 - 03:00:01.430]: No, I -- I would not say that the Ukrainians are inept.

K. MICHAEL CONAWAY [03:00:01.440 - 03:00:30.778]: All right, thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman, I would like as a personal request request that you and or one of your lawyer members on the committee that lawyers to put into the record the federal statute that provides for the absolute immunity or right to immunity that you've asserted over and over. And over -- I don't think it's there, but if it is in fact federal statute and or a brief that you can cite, put that into the record so that we'll know that. And before you get mad and -- and accuse me wanted to out the whistleblower, you get upset every time somebody accuses you personally of knowing who the story is. I get upset every time you add an image -- excuse me, anonymity every time you accuse me of simply because I want to know the whistleblower. We want to know what's going on that we want to out that interview.

K. MICHAEL CONAWAY [03:00:30.778 - 03:01:00.116]: That's unfair for you to make that accusation and I get just this man, this is about leveling the playing field between our two teams. Your team knows a whistleblower, they have intimate knowledge of who he or she is that IGC, ICICI each and even mentioned in the sea of biases. Your team fully understands that our team should fully understand that it's simply levelling the playing field.

K. MICHAEL CONAWAY [03:01:00.116 - 03:01:29.454]: And I know that you've overrun my request for a closed door subpoena. I understand that. But I do think that it's important that you put it on the record, the basis on which you continue to assert its absolute right to anonymity. Excuse me, I misspoke earlier, anonymity. The whistleblower also the speaker on September the twenty third issued a dear colleague.

K. MICHAEL CONAWAY [03:01:29.454 - 03:01:58.792]: That's a document that we all use to talk to each other. It's meant to 434 other members of Congress. It was intended to be the truth. It was intended to be straightforward. She says in that dear colleague that the whistleblower has by law is required to testify to the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees.

K. MICHAEL CONAWAY [03:01:58.792 - 03:02:28.130]: Now you're defying the sit the speaker in this regard, understand that's between you and her. But if she's correct, then you're defying the speaker, the divine the law. If on the other hand, she misled us into thinking something that was not true. Then I think you need to tell the speaker that she needs to retract that. Your colleague letter at least set the record straight as is the speaker is the whistleblower required by law as the speaker said to testify to us or not. And what is is absolutely right to anonymity that that you question that I yield back time of the gentleman has expired.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [03:02:28.330 - 03:02:41.590]: Happy to enter into the record the whistleblower statute that allows whistleblower to remain anonymous as well as ranking member Nunez prior comments talking about the importance of anonymity for whistleblowers. And with that, I recognize this.

UNIDENTIFIED [03:02:41.620 - 03:03:02.910]: Sewell Thank you, Mr. Chairman, ambassador, Volker. It seems by early July it's become pretty clear that Mr. Giuliani has become a major problem for the U.S., Ukraine relations. You previously testified that on July 2nd you met with the Ukrainian President and his aide and Toronto. Is that right?

KURT VOLKER [03:03:02.930 - 03:03:31.840]: I had a bilateral meeting between the U.S. and Ukraine and delegations and then a publicized meeting with the President and his chief of staff there. You discuss Mr. Giuliani's quote, negative view quote of Ukraine based on a conspiracy theory about the 2016 election, right? I conveyed that he was repeating a negative narrative about Ukraine based on accusations of the then prosecutor general sinker.

MIKE QUIGLEY [03:03:31.860 - 03:03:45.980]: Are you saying that you didn't think that they were negative views? No, no, that they were negative views, but that wasn't your -- that wasn't your description. I'm -- I'm sorry, I've lost the question if you could reply.

KURT VOLKER [03:03:45.990 - 03:04:03.230]: I was trying to get at who's who said the negative views that you just negative though the prosecutor general of Ukraine was putting out this series of conspiracy theories that I believe were self-serving and inaccurate. Mr Giuliani had repeated these to me. So I believe that he was the least affected by those and believe those and was concerned and believe that they were negative, believe that they were negative and was conveying them to the President.

KURT VOLKER [03:04:03.230 - 03:04:20.470]: So was it problematic that he believed that they were negative views?

JAMES A. HIMES [03:04:20.690 - 03:04:23.780]: Yes, the whole thing was problematic.

KURT VOLKER [03:04:23.810 - 03:04:43.915]: Ambassador Taylor testified that on July 2nd you told Ukrainians that they needed to quote cooperate on investigations in quote. You're now saying that you don't recall that saying those words, is that correct? I don't believe I said the words cooperate on investigations. Did you say investigations? I believe I did, yes.

KURT VOLKER [03:04:43.915 - 03:05:04.020]: And what did you mean by investigation? I meant Brisbane 2016 was in my mind, but I wanted to keep it general and that Ukraine in being convincing to Giuliani and hopefully also to the President that they are serious about fighting corruption would engage in whatever investigations necessary to clean up the country.

UNIDENTIFIED [03:05:04.070 - 03:05:20.650]: Now moving to July 10th, Ambassador Volker sent you a text message, you sent a text message to Giuliani and I think it's on the same screen now. And you said Mr. Mayor could we meet for coffee or lunch in the next week or so?

KURT VOLKER [03:05:20.660 - 03:05:43.503]: I'd like to update you on my conversations about Ukraine. I'd like -- I think we have an opportunity to get what you need. Did you say that? Is that accurate? That is an accurate text message and what did you mean by what you need contact with the actual government of Ukraine, the people who are now representing presence Lenski and his team later that day, U.N. ambassador, Sunderland, met with Ukraine officials at the White House.

KURT VOLKER [03:05:43.503 - 03:06:06.347]: We heard from several witnesses that Ambassador Sunderland told the Ukrainians that they needed to cooperate with the quote unquote investigations in order to get the Oval Office meeting that scheduled on the books were these investigations a part of the official U.S. policy towards Ukraine, u.S. policy toward Ukraine was about fighting corruption in Ukraine.

KURT VOLKER [03:06:06.347 - 03:06:29.190]: Was it that typically about these kinds of investigation, you said the investigation was presumably in order to fight corruption, you need to conduct investigations, you need to see what Ukrainian citizens have been up to and doing. What was the purpose of that or was it or was it because the President know you knew that?

TERRI A. SEWELL [03:06:29.550 - 03:06:39.810]: Well, the President wanted those investigations to be done as a condition for them to actually have a meeting with the -- with the White House and the White House.

KURT VOLKER [03:06:40.260 - 03:06:56.670]: Well, first off, we have to be clear what we're talking about in terms of investigations. We're not talking about Vice President Biden, we're not talking about something called charisma, doesn't is not. There has nothing to do with -- you're saying that I'm saying that whether Ukrainians within the company of charisma had acted in a corrupt way or sought to buy influence, that's a legitimate thing for Ukraine to investigate.

KURT VOLKER [03:06:56.670 - 03:07:13.080]: And if Ukraine can make a statement about their intentions on fighting corruption domestically, that is helpful in order to convince President Trump ultimately that this is all due respect.

UNIDENTIFIED [03:07:13.080 - 03:07:34.020]: Ambassador Volker, we heard from two witnesses this morning that those investigations were not official U.S. policy ambassador. Volker, I don't know if you understand what you were getting yourself into, but sitting here today, I trust you understand that pressuring Ukraine to involve itself in U.S. domestic policy. Is just simply wrong?

TERRI A. SEWELL [03:07:34.020 - 03:07:39.720]: I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Turner.

MICHAEL R. TURNER [03:07:39.720 - 03:07:42.180]: I yield my time to Jim Jordan.

UNIDENTIFIED [03:07:42.250 - 03:07:57.820]: I think the gentleman Ambassador Volker you were the special Representative to Ukraine, is that right? That is correct. And prior to that and your diplomatic service, you worked at the NSC, your deputy assistant Secretary of state, you were ambassador to NATO Senate, confirmed ambassador to NATO. In your distinguished diplomatic career.

JIM JORDAN [03:07:58.540 - 03:08:18.843]: So it may not bother you when you're referred to as the irregular channel, but it bothers Representative Turner, It bothers me. You were the special on boy to Ukraine. And in that role, you said in your opening statement, you were the administration's most outspoken public figure highlighting Russia's invasion and occupation of Ukraine and calling out Russia's responsibility in the war.

JIM JORDAN [03:08:18.843 - 03:08:39.146]: Is that right, that is correct and in that capacity you strongly advocated for lifting the ban on sale of lethal defensive arms to Ukraine. Is that right? That is correct. And President Trump did it, didn't he that is correct. But in spite of that, President Trump was still skeptical of giving hard earned tax dollars to Ukraine, right?

JIM JORDAN [03:08:39.146 - 03:08:59.449]: Yes, you said that in your testimony as well. The reason I'm skeptical is let's be honest, the guy didn't like foreign aid, right? That's one reason. And then Ukraine's history of corruption is another one of the third most corrupt countries on the planet. And Europe isn't doing enough and oh, by the way in the President's mind, he did think Ukraine was trying to influence the 2016 election because things happened.

JIM JORDAN [03:08:59.449 - 03:09:19.751]: The Democrats want to deny it, but when the bastard from Ukraine here, the United States writes an op ed on August 4th, 2016 criticizing then candidate Trump. That's certainly trying to influence the election. When Mr. Volkoff named, a key minister in their government says all kinds of negative things about candidate Trump.

JIM JORDAN [03:09:19.751 - 03:09:40.054]: That certainly looks like it's trying to influence the election well, Mr. La Cinco states in the financial times during the campaign, the majority of Ukraine and political figures want Hillary Clinton to win. That probably sticks in a candidate's mind. I know we all run campaigns when people say bad things about us in the course of the campaign.

JIM JORDAN [03:09:40.054 - 03:10:00.357]: We don't necessarily necessarily think great things about them, but you were convinced Zelinsky was the real deal, right? That is correct because you spent a lot of time with the guy and guess what -- when aid was frozen, you knew if you could get these two guys together and work out when aid was frozen, What did you say?

JIM JORDAN [03:10:00.357 - 03:10:20.660]: You told the Ukrainians don't worry about it. Well, you don't say -- you said don't be alarmed. Yeah, right, that is correct. And guess what happened by the time AIDS when AIDS frozen and when it's released, all kinds of interactions between President Zelinsky and senior U.S. officials, right starts with the call starts with the call with President Trump and presence Lynskey.

JIM JORDAN [03:10:20.660 - 03:10:40.963]: Next day you meet with President Lynskey in Ukraine, then we have Ambassador Bolton meeting with him. Then we have Vice President Penn's meeting with him. Then we have U.S. Senators, Johnson and Murphy meeting with him and guess what in none of those meetings, not a single one. The security assistance dollars in exchange for an investigation.

JIM JORDAN [03:10:40.963 - 03:11:01.266]: Not once did they come up to that thing that did that conversation come up, is that right? That is correct, not once no discussion of aid for investigations and as you testified, you never believed a four investigations was ever being talked about either in any of these conversations. That is correct, but what happened in those meetings, they all became convinced of the same thing.

JIM JORDAN [03:11:01.266 - 03:11:21.569]: You knew they all saw this same darn thing. This guy was the real deal. He is a legitimate reformer and they all came back. They all came back and told the President, hey, Mr. President this guy's real go ahead release the dollars, oh, by the way in that same timeframe you know what else happened. Their parliament, their newly elected parliament as Mr. Morrison testified to stayed up all night to pass the reform measures to get rid of the prosecutor to put in the Supreme High anti-corruption court to get rid of this, this -- this -- this -- this ability that that.

JIM JORDAN [03:11:21.569 - 03:11:41.871]: That no one in their Congress and their parliament can ever be hit with a crime. I mean that's unbelief all that happens and they come back and tell President Trump, hey, guess what time to release the dollars and he did it right. The dollars were released. Yeah, you did your job, you did your job and you got to put up with all this because the Democrats are out to get this President.

JIM JORDAN [03:11:41.871 - 03:12:02.174]: You did your job just the way Mr. Turner described you did your job over all these years, all these years and the Democrats put you through this. You have served our country well, the kind of the kind of diplomat we want served. And here's -- here's the -- here's the saddest, one of the saddest things about all this.

JIM JORDAN [03:12:02.174 - 03:12:22.477]: That what the Democrats are putting us through you, two guys who are here telling it straight, you've both decided you're going to step out of government because of what these guys are doing and that that's the sad thing. People like Ambassador Volker and Tim Morris, who have served our country so well are now stepping out of our government because of what these guys are doing.

JIM JORDAN [03:12:22.477 - 03:12:42.780]: And that's why Mr. Turner got so fired up a few minutes ago, why I'm so fired up to because we appreciate we appreciate what you guys did I yield back.

UNIDENTIFIED [03:12:42.840 - 03:12:56.830]: Thank you, chairmanship ambassador Volker. I want to focus on the press statement that President Trump and Rudy Giuliani wanted Ukraine to make announce announcing investigations to benefit President Trump on August 9. Sir.

ANDRE CARSON [03:12:56.910 - 03:13:10.920]: Ambassador Sandlin and you had this exchange Ambassador. Solomon says Morrison ready to get dates as soon as your math confirms you reply.

KURT VOLKER [03:13:10.960 - 03:13:39.020]: Excellent, how did you sway him? Ambassador? Simon says not sure I did. I think poultice really wants a deliverable deliverable. Here was a public announcement that Ukraine was going to conduct investigations into Berrimah and alleged 2016 legend interference by Ukraine. Is that correct, sir? Thank you. I understood the deliverable to be the statement that we have been talking about on August 13th.

ANDRE CARSON [03:13:39.020 - 03:13:47.380]: U.N Ambassador Sutherland discussed a draft statement from Ukraine with Mr. Giuliani. Sir, why did you discuss the draft statement with Mr. Giuliani?

KURT VOLKER [03:13:47.480 - 03:14:19.985]: Because the idea the statement had come up from Mr. earmarks meeting with Mr. Giuliani, remember that Mr. earmark asked me to connect him with Mr. Giuliani. I did -- they had a meeting and then they both called me afterwards. Mr. Giuliani said that he thought Ukraine should make a statement about fighting corruption, Mr. Yarmouk said and we will say also specifically Boris in 2016, Mr. Yamma provided me a draft statement and I wanted to be assured that this statement would actually correct the perception that Mr. Giuliani had of Ukraine and what they stand for now?

KURT VOLKER [03:14:19.985 - 03:14:52.490]: So that that would also be conveyed to President Trump and solve this problem that I had observed with our May 20, 30 meeting with the President. The problem being that he's getting a bad set of information, statements like this could potentially correct that. So was Mr. Giuliani satisfied with this statement? No, he was not when he believed that it needed to say Boris Ma and 2016 specifically or else it would not be credible, would not mean anything new.

UNIDENTIFIED [03:14:53.930 - 03:15:16.060]: So in fact, Mr. Giuliani wanted a statement that a reference charisma and the 2016 elections explicitly, one that would benefit essentially President Trump, Mr. Ambassador, here's the text you sent to the Ukrainian official on August 13th. Let's put that up on the screen you said. Hi, Andre. Good talking following is the text with an insert at the end for the two key items, Mr. Ambassador, those two, two key items was specific references to investigations of charisma and the 2016 elections.

UNIDENTIFIED [03:15:16.060 - 03:15:38.190]: Isn't that right, sir? That is correct. Did Mr. Giuliani? Sir dictate those two key items to you, sir.

KURT VOLKER [03:15:38.190 - 03:15:53.210]: Well, as you see, I just had a conversation with Mr. Jarmon to describe to him the conversation that we had just had with Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani said that it would need to include these things for it to be convincing to him. I put them in. So we understood what he was talking about and I shared it with Andre to say this is what he is talking about.

KURT VOLKER [03:15:53.210 - 03:16:08.230]: And you included them in the proposal to the Ukrainians, I put it back in to be clear to the Ukrainians. This is what the conversation was.

ANDRE CARSON [03:16:08.250 - 03:16:21.270]: Mr. Ambassador, if you believe the statement that Mr. Giuliani dictated in August was not a good idea, sir, why were the Ukrainians still considering giving an interview with the same themes in September?

KURT VOLKER [03:16:21.300 - 03:16:40.875]: Well, if I may Congressman, I conveyed this to the Ukrainians in order to be clear. So we knew what the conversation was about. This was following up on his prior conversation. The Ukrainians then said they had reasons not to do that and they described those reasons that I agreed with them and we agreed to just scrap the statement from that point on. I didn't have any further conversations about this statement.

KURT VOLKER [03:16:40.875 - 03:17:00.450]: So I don't know how it came up or why it came up and that there would be a possibility of presence Zelinsky doing an interview with U.S. media later saying something like this and in the end he didn't do that either.

ANDRE CARSON [03:17:01.170 - 03:17:18.435]: Thank you, sir. Mr. Morrison, you said that the President's requests during the July 25th call were not consistent with U.S. policy. I emphatically agree with you, sir. Yep, these text messages show that Ambassador Volker spent much of August pressing Ukraine to meet those requests. We can only be grateful I guess if the President essentially got caught and Congress passed a law to ensure the funding was released for Ukraine before was too late.

ANDRE CARSON [03:17:18.435 - 03:17:35.700]: I thank you both for your service, Mr. Chairman. I yield back Dr. instruct.

BRAD R. WENSTRUP [03:17:35.720 - 03:17:48.185]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, both gentlemen, thank you very much for being here. I want to start if I can with you Mr. Morris and I discussing the 725 phone call and the concerns that Lieutenant Colonel Denman had. Lieutenant Colonel Blum came to you with edits for the transcript and you stated that you accepted all of his edits.

BRAD R. WENSTRUP [03:17:48.185 - 03:18:00.650]: Is that correct?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [03:18:00.900 - 03:18:08.510]: I guess I would have accepted all of the edits that I believed were more faithful to what was actually discussed.

BRAD R. WENSTRUP [03:18:08.510 - 03:18:22.350]: Did he come to you with an edit that said that the word demand should be in there? I don't -- I don't recall that specifically, so he didn't either how soon after the phone call did he meet with you on that particular issue?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [03:18:22.350 - 03:18:27.480]: We -- we got the draft as was normal fairly quickly after the call.

BRAD R. WENSTRUP [03:18:27.690 - 03:18:54.506]: That same day that same day. So today he said I reported my concerns to Mr. Eisenberg. It is improper for the present United States to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and political opponent and he was going to Mr. Eisenberg with his concerns about the conversation. Yet he did not at any point on the edits say that there should be a demand and you know he did, he didn't do that. But he did say that he didn't come to you with his concerns because you weren't available.

BRAD R. WENSTRUP [03:18:54.506 - 03:19:21.321]: But that same day he came to you with with edits is that -- was that correct? I believe that's generally correct. Yes, sir. okay. Well, he said you weren't available and you didn't hear the President make a demand. Did you? No sir. So sometime between the call and today, Lieutenant Colonel Bittman must have been hearing some voices and he heard demand at the time, but he didn't hear it that day and he didn't make it an issue that day.

BRAD R. WENSTRUP [03:19:21.321 - 03:19:48.137]: But today he does, I think that's pretty bizarre when Lieutenant Colonel then went to legal. Mr. Eisenberg, Do you know if he was advised not to speak to you? I don't have any firsthand knowledge of that. No sir. Do you know if he was advised to contact the IRGC? No, sir, I have no firsthand knowledge about.

BRAD R. WENSTRUP [03:19:48.137 - 03:20:14.953]: So you don't know what he was advised when he went to legal. No, sir, I do not. Thank you. I appreciate that. Mr. Volker, I want to tell you, I've really enjoyed your opening testimony today, taking us through that. I know it's kind of long, but I thought it was extremely well done and I appreciate it. You talk about letter signed and and sharing concerns about leadership in your assigned country about agreeing with and sometimes disagreeing with the leadership of your own country. When when you felt it was appropriate?

BRAD R. WENSTRUP [03:20:14.953 - 03:20:41.769]: Now you're the boots on the ground for the administration, let's face it, you're part of that team that is there to -- to serve the country in that way. And that all to me sounded like the works of a very good diplomat. And I want to thank you for that. Thank you, sir. It's truly appreciate it. And you know, corruption was a concern legitimately in Ukraine and in many ways.

BRAD R. WENSTRUP [03:20:41.769 - 03:21:08.584]: And Mr. Joyner, Jordan pointed out some of the things that were done by Ukrainians in plain sight. I might use that term in plain sight by putting up ads in our newspapers and it's certainly more than one country can be trying to influence our elections. Would you agree with that? I agree with that and you know we keep hearing that that whole thing about Ukrainians, that's all been debunked. It was just the Russians, well, you know, that comes from an icy community that some of the people that have come up with those conclusions are some of the very same people that we're going to find out. If we haven't already were deeply involved with this whole Russian collusion hoax.

BRAD R. WENSTRUP [03:21:08.584 - 03:21:35.400]: But I want to say you did a great job, you vetted the Lewinsky's intentions what he intended to be as a President, which would you say that's accurate?

KURT VOLKER [03:21:35.950 - 03:21:42.910]: Yes, that was in fact one of the key objectives of the Presidential delegation at the inauguration to take our own judgment and report back to the President.

BRAD R. WENSTRUP [03:21:42.970 - 03:21:56.150]: And that's what your job should be and you became comfortable with this President, correct. Yes, I did. And you worked to assure our President that you were comfortable with this, isn't that correct? That's correct. And in some ways, you have to work sometimes through any means available, and that might include working with Rudy Giuliani, if it could be helpful to you to get that message and advice to the President.

BRAD R. WENSTRUP [03:21:56.150 - 03:22:09.330]: Would that be correct?

KURT VOLKER [03:22:09.340 - 03:22:27.850]: I believe that the message is being conveyed by Mr. Giuliani were a problem because they were -- they were at variance with our official message to the President was and not conveying that positive assessment that we all had. And so I thought it was important to try to step in and fix the problem.

BRAD R. WENSTRUP [03:22:27.970 - 03:22:37.390]: And in that, I think you turned out a useful barometer of where things were. Yes, so there's useful barometers. I think can come in a lot of different fashions like Dennis Rodman in North Korea or James Taylor in France thing. And you got a friend if they can help the cause and in that situation it's not illegal.

BRAD R. WENSTRUP [03:22:37.390 - 03:22:46.810]: Good job Ambassador.

JACKIE SPEIER [03:22:46.810 - 03:23:13.002]: Thank you very much. Jack spear Chairman, thank you and thank you both for your participation here today and for your service. I want to take us out some 30000 feet for a minute and talk about cover ups. But for the fact that the whistleblower came forward, we wouldn't know anything about this, but for the fact that the inspector general of the CIA found it to be both urgent and credible.

JACKIE SPEIER [03:23:13.002 - 03:23:39.193]: We wouldn't know anything about it. Mr. Morrison, you said that after you heard the call, you went directly to the attorneys in the National Security Council and recommended that they be limited access and they were subsequently put into a special server. The White House has not released any documents whatsoever to this committee.

JACKIE SPEIER [03:23:39.193 - 03:24:05.385]: So do you -- Mr. Volcker, thank you, but for the fact that you as a private citizen with your own personal phone and your text messages with Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Sandlin and Mr. Nayak and whomever else. But for those text messages that we've been putting up on the screen all day, we would have nothing, nothing and this cover up would be complete. That's something we should think about now.

JACKIE SPEIER [03:24:05.385 - 03:24:31.577]: On July 19th, you had breakfast with Rudy Giuliani at the Trump Hotel correct and correct in that conversation. At one point, he brought up Mr. lewd Sancho and you said that whatever Mr. lewd Sancho is saying that's not credible. Is that correct? Yes. And then he brought up Mr. Biden and I'm going to quote you here.

JACKIE SPEIER [03:24:31.577 - 03:24:57.768]: I've known him for a long time. He's a person of integrity to Giuliani. Simply not credible to me, joe Biden would be influenced in his duties as Vice President by money or things for a son or anything like that. We've had many discussions over the last few days about these investigations into Burris MMA and Biden and the 2016 Crowd Strike server and you in that conversation with Mr. Giuliani basically debunked all of that.

JACKIE SPEIER [03:24:57.768 - 03:25:23.960]: Now at that time at that breakfast who else was with you at that breakfast?

KURT VOLKER [03:25:24.040 - 03:25:33.970]: There was someone that Mr. Giuliani brought along I later learned that this was left Panos who we've learned a lot about since then.

JACKIE SPEIER [03:25:33.970 - 03:25:53.105]: So Mr. left, Parness was at that breakfast that Mr. Giuliani had with you and we now know that Mr. Parnassus has since been indicted for campaign foreign campaign contributions to President Trump's political action committee. Is that correct? I have seen it all right on May 20 3rd you were in that discussion with the President and at one point he referred to Zelinsky having terrible people around him.

JACKIE SPEIER [03:25:53.105 - 03:26:12.240]: Who do you think he was calling terrible people around him? There were two people that came to mind.

KURT VOLKER [03:26:12.340 - 03:26:34.000]: One of them was a former investigative journalist and later a parliamentarian named sir he lost Schenkel said he lost Janko is someone that in many of these stories is seen as bringing forth a black ledger relating to Paul Manafort activities in Ukraine. That was one person. The other person I thought I could refer to was the person who was being named as presence of Lewinsky's chief of Presidential administration, Andre Bogden.

KURT VOLKER [03:26:34.000 - 03:26:55.660]: He was known as a lawyer for one of the main oligarchs in Ukraine. You got a call boy ski and there was a lot of controversy at the time about him being appointed to the administration. Do you call that? Do you think of them as terrible people?

JACKIE SPEIER [03:26:55.660 - 03:27:17.183]: I don't think either one of them is terrible people, no. All right. Thank you. Mr. Morrison earlier in testimony that was elicited from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you indicated that others had represented to you that Colonel Veneman leaked. You remember saying that, yes, ma'am, all right.

JACKIE SPEIER [03:27:17.183 - 03:27:38.707]: Colonel Veneman this morning under oath said that he did not does not leak. Now. Would you therefore want to maybe briefly rearrange your comments about the references you made to Colonel Veneman? No ma'am. So even even though under oath, he said that he has never leaked. You believe that you believing people who said to you that he may have leaked.

JACKIE SPEIER [03:27:38.707 - 03:28:00.230]: I didn't believe or disbelieve them, I'm merely rich, then one day told me well they told you and so then you decided to continue to put that forward even though you had no evidence. No. Thank you.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [03:28:00.230 - 03:28:24.430]: I yield back ma'am, bumps, I'm sorry, German and if I could answer ma'am that's incorrect. They -- Dr. Hill, Mr. Erath, others in the NSC raised concerns about Alex. Those concerns were noted. I didn't take them for face value. I did. I treated them as representations of others. I was on alert, but I formed my own judgments.

KURT VOLKER [03:28:24.440 - 03:28:47.897]: I took no action because of the statements of someone else that I couldn't independently validate. Stuart. Thank you, gentlemen. Welcome to impeach a palooza 20 19, which is the Democratic plan to compel America to impeach President Donald J. Trump through the sheer force of boredom because it's been a long day and it turns out impeachment is very boring if you don't have any compelling or any condemning evidence.

KURT VOLKER [03:28:47.897 - 03:29:11.354]: Good news and bad news, the good news is I'm going to be very, very brief or going on 10 plus hours of this. I will yield back some of my time. The bad news is most my colleagues after me won't. So he's still got some time to go. Ambassador Volker very quickly. Do you think that someone should be immune from investigation of suspected ethical or criminal activity just because they were a candidate for office even for office of the President, United States?

KURT VOLKER [03:29:11.354 - 03:29:34.811]: I don't think anyone should be above the law. Well, of course not that would be absurd to suggest that I was certain that's how you would answer that question. What if some of these alleged ethical or criminal allegations occurred overseas that occurred in another country, would it be improper to seek the host countries help such as we do with Interpol or any other law enforcement agency?

KURT VOLKER [03:29:34.811 - 03:29:58.269]: There are channels for doing that for American citizens who may have committed crimes abroad and again to seek the host nations that their governments help is not unusual at all what it is that is correct and you often have treaties for them. Thank you again. That's painfully obvious and to me that's exactly and the only thing that the President was doing.

KURT VOLKER [03:29:58.269 - 03:30:21.726]: Mr. Morrison, I wonder if I could just briefly to Lieutenant Colonel Vinson's testimony where he described the six people I believe as five or six people that were in the situation room. Listening to this phone call between the two Presidents, colonel Vinson described these individuals as exceptional. He stated that there was no reason to question their integrity or professionalism.

KURT VOLKER [03:30:21.726 - 03:30:45.183]: This was an exchange that he and I had in the closed door testimony. Do you agree with the description of this national, these national security staff as exceptional people or they are patriots? Yes, people of great integrity and professionalism. Yes, sir, do any of these? I'm sorry, did any of these exceptional individuals, people of unquestioned integrity and professionalism indicate to you that they had thought that the President of the United States didn't get engaged in any illegal or an ethical behavior as a result of this phone call?

KURT VOLKER [03:30:45.183 - 03:31:08.640]: Not that I'm aware of, Congressman, did any of them suggest to you in any way that they thought the President was involved with bribery or any such thing associated with them?

CHRIS STEWART [03:31:08.640 - 03:31:09.270]: Not that I'm aware of.

KURT VOLKER [03:31:09.270 - 03:31:28.620]: Congressman, you know, it's only -- that only leaves two possible explanations either these individuals or what we've described as a great integrity either that's not true, which I don't believe or they just interpreted an ambiguous conversation very differently than did Colonel. And I have not saying just as an aside as an Air Force officer, I've never understood why President Obama was against providing lethal aid to Ukraine.

KURT VOLKER [03:31:28.620 - 03:31:47.970]: Ambassador, do you have some insight into why they refused to do that? I would only point to the statements from the administration at the time there is a perception that our allies would oppose it that Germany would oppose it. There was a perception that Germany should be in the lead. There was a perception that it could be provocative to Russia or escalate the conflict.

KURT VOLKER [03:31:47.970 - 03:32:07.320]: As I've said extensively at the time and as a special Representative, I don't agree with those arguments and I believe that the record is borne out that providing those lethal defensive arms was actually very important. I agree with the ambassador. I think that you got it right.

UNIDENTIFIED [03:32:07.320 - 03:32:24.950]: And I think President Trump got it right. And with the -- I yield back the squiggly Amos term Ambassador, I want to direct your attention to a meeting you had with Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Mack.

MIKE QUIGLEY [03:32:25.250 - 03:32:51.610]: September 14th in key you call this meeting, sir. I believe we had dinner is around the time of the U.S. Conference. okay. And you remember discussing with Mr. Mack Ukraine's intent to investigate their former President, Mr. Poroshenko. I remember raising the issue of the possibility of prosecution. They brought it up is that Cory raised it and they talked about their intent here.

KURT VOLKER [03:32:51.890 - 03:33:12.433]: Excuse me, Congressman, I'm sorry to be clear. There was a lot of talk in Kiev at that time about whether the new team would be prosecuting the former President and I had met with President Poroshenko and met with others in the opposition as well. And I wanted to call Mr. earmarks attention to the potential problems of this.

KURT VOLKER [03:33:12.433 - 03:33:32.975]: I'm very familiar with other examples of countries in the region that have gone for prosecutions of the former government and these have created deep divisions in society. And so I cited President Zelinsky whose inauguration speech -- I'm sorry his National Day speech from August 24th that was all about unifying the country.

KURT VOLKER [03:33:32.975 - 03:33:53.518]: And I cautioned Mr. Obama to say that pursuing prosecution of President Poroshenko risks, deepening the divisions in the country, exactly the opposite of what President Zelinsky has said he wants to do. So it's fair to describe it are you discouraged him from such action. I -- I discouraged him, I raised concerns about what the potential impact would be and what was Mr. your max response?

KURT VOLKER [03:33:53.518 - 03:34:14.060]: I believe that I am refreshed in this by seeing the testimony of others. Mr. Taylor, Mr. Taylor's testimony, Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Kent, right?

MIKE QUIGLEY [03:34:14.060 - 03:34:39.300]: And I believe based on that testimony that Mr. Hammack said well, what you mean like asking us to investigate Clinton invited. So was was something along the lines of it's okay for you to ask us to investigate the manner in which you are these so-called investigations. But you don't want us to investigate Iran present, is that fair way to describe this?

KURT VOLKER [03:34:39.300 - 03:35:02.250]: Well, I didn't quite understand what he was referring to because to my knowledge, we weren't asking to investigate Clinton or Biden. And so I was kind of puzzled by the remark and that's why I didn't respond. Did you go and investigate what he might have meant or ask anybody? No. I thought, Ah, I took it something of a deflection from the point I was making about unifying Ukraine in all this time.

MIKE QUIGLEY [03:35:02.250 - 03:35:18.190]: I mean, Mr. Giuliani in this time and that made September, he mentioned the Biden investigation, he mentioned Biden over 50 times and 20 something times. And in relation to Ukraine, none of that stirred your curiosity.

KURT VOLKER [03:35:18.210 - 03:35:39.500]: Well, as I'll finally come to this point, know, as I testified, I met with Mr. Giuliani once and he did bring up Vice President Biden and I pushed back on that. And I maintained a very clear distinction that Ukraine investigating its own citizens and corruption would be fine. Going beyond that to say we're going investigate the Vice President is not fine.

MIKE QUIGLEY [03:35:39.510 - 03:35:49.350]: Did you have any discussions with anyone in the State Department or anywhere else in the administration about concerns about the investigation in the poor Sancho, yes?

KURT VOLKER [03:35:49.800 - 03:36:09.390]: So I know that I raised this with Ambassador Taylor in advance of that. We had been in some of the same meetings, some of the country team there. I don't remember whether I had raised it with George Kent or Phil, Rick or not, I may well have done, but it was something that we had discussed as part of our meetings and give at that time.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [03:36:09.750 - 03:36:27.710]: I yield to the Chairman Sylvester, well, you had this conversation and you urged Ukrainians not to investigate to prosecute the former President Poroshenko their response was, Oh, you mean like you're asking us to investigate the Clintons and the Bidens that was their response.

KURT VOLKER [03:36:27.750 - 03:36:30.780]: That's what I recall now from seeing Ambassador Taylor's testimony.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [03:36:30.780 - 03:36:51.780]: And you didn't understand that at the time, but then at the time had you read the call record no. Now you've read the call record that makes a little more sense. Doesn't it? Yes, you know I was careful something you said earlier when you said that the 2016 conspiracy theory of loot Sankoh had no merit, but you didn't see any harm in Ukraine investigating it if they want to investigate it. Is that right?

ADAM B. SCHIFF [03:36:51.780 - 03:37:12.780]: Yes, don't they have enough legitimate Corruption to investigate without spending time investigating a debunk conspiracy theory. There is all kinds of corruption to investigate in Ukraine, but nonetheless you propose that they go ahead and do this investigation was something you thought without merit because this was part of an effort to fix the problem that Giuliani was creating.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [03:37:12.780 - 03:37:33.780]: I did not propose it well, I think you said you were okay with it or you amended statement as we've seen to include it because well, if it would help fix the Giuliani problem, was that the thinking? Yes, that's -- that's correct.

KURT VOLKER [03:37:33.790 - 03:37:43.840]: If it threads the needle between what is reasonable for Ukraine to do and if it resets the negative perceptions held by Mr. Giuliani and then the President, then then why not?

ADAM B. SCHIFF [03:37:43.840 - 03:38:00.160]: This is part of what you described in your opening statement as your effort to when you see a problem to fix it. Is it clear to now Ambassador Volker based on the September 25th call? You were not able to fix it based on the transcript that was released on the 25th?

KURT VOLKER [03:38:01.000 - 03:38:19.990]: I can see now that there are a lot else going on that was about Vice President Biden. Then I knew at the time and I -- The efforts that I was making were clearly not in the context of what had already been discussed by the President july 25th. It's fair to say you were not able to fix the Giuliani problem.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [03:38:19.990 - 03:38:20.620]: That's correct.

ELISE M. STEFANIK [03:38:23.810 - 03:38:42.972]: Mr. Fanning Thank you, Ambassador Volker and Mr. Morrison for your years of service and your professional expertise and leadership on national security issues. And I want to particularly thank Mr. Morrison for his great work on the House Armed Services Committee on which I serve. I wanted to start with the July 25th call between President Trump and Presidents Alinsky.

ELISE M. STEFANIK [03:38:42.972 - 03:39:02.133]: Mr. Morrison, you were on that call and there was no mention of withholding aid on the call, correct? That is correct. And there was no quid pro quo correct, correct? No bribery correct? No extortion, correct. And Ambassador Voltaire Volker, I presume you got a readout of the call, is that correct? Very terse read Elba?

ELISE M. STEFANIK [03:39:02.133 - 03:39:21.295]: Yes, in this tertiary readout of the call, ambassador from the U.S. participants, was there any reference to withholding aid? No, there was not any reference to bribery. No, there was not any reference to quid pro quo. No, there was not any reference to extortion. No, there was none and I presume you also got feedback from your Ukrainian counterparts as to how the call went?

ELISE M. STEFANIK [03:39:21.295 - 03:39:40.457]: Did they mention the withholding of aid? No, they did not. Did they mention any quid pro quo? No, they didn't. And did they mention any bribery? No, they did not. And in fact, the day after the call, you met with Presidents Alinsky. This would be on July 26. That's good. And in that meeting, he made no mention of quid pro quo.

ELISE M. STEFANIK [03:39:40.457 - 03:39:59.618]: No, he made no mention of withholding the aid. No, he made no mention of bribery, no. So the fact is the Ukrainians were not even aware of this hold on aid. Is that correct? That's correct. And in the coming weeks, you were in touch with Ukrainians as part of your official duties and this included talking to Ukrainians over the phone in person on text.

ELISE M. STEFANIK [03:39:59.618 - 03:40:18.780]: And the Ukrainians never brought up an investigation into the Biden's. Is that correct? That's correct. They never brought up the withholding of the aid. That's correct. They never brought up quid pro quo or bribery.

KURT VOLKER [03:40:18.780 - 03:40:22.880]: Let me bring up the aid. They didn't bring that up after the Politico article appeared on that.

ELISE M. STEFANIK [03:40:22.890 - 03:40:43.251]: I'm going to get to that, but until the political article, they did not bring it up. And you said in your closed door deposition quote, It never came up in conversation with them. And I believe they had trust in me that they would have asked if that was really what they were worried about. Is that correct? That is correct.

ELISE M. STEFANIK [03:40:43.251 - 03:41:03.613]: And as you pointed out, the Ukrainians never even knew their foreign aid was on pause until the article was published in Politico in August. That's correct. So they didn't know during the call. That's correct. And in fact, you had to correct chairman Schiff on this timeline in the closed door deposition. The chairman of this committee asked you quote when they became aware that military assistance was being withheld for a reason you couldn't explain. No one could explain.

ELISE M. STEFANIK [03:41:03.613 - 03:41:23.974]: Weren't they under even greater pressure to give the President what he asked for on the call and you answered Ambassador Volker quote. To my knowledge, the news about a hold on security assistance did not get into Ukrainian government circles. As indicated to me by the current foreign minister, then diplomatic adviser until the end of August.

ELISE M. STEFANIK [03:41:23.974 - 03:41:44.336]: Is that your testimony? Yes, it is. And Chairman Schiff also got the facts wrong. Again, when he asked you this quote at the point they learned their aid was paused, wouldn't they give then wouldn't that give them added urgency to meet the President's request on the Bidens? And you answered Ambassador Volker quote, I think the Ukrainians felt like they are going in the right direction and they had not done anything. They had not done anything on an investigation end quote.

ELISE M. STEFANIK [03:41:44.336 - 03:42:04.697]: Isn't it the case Ambassador Volker at one point chairmanship said to you when you were truthfully testifying quote Ambassador, you're making this much more complicated than it has to be and quote page 127 from the deposition. Is that correct? I remember that. But the truth is the facts are indeed not complicated and I'm gonna close out with two questions for the both of you.

ELISE M. STEFANIK [03:42:04.697 - 03:42:25.059]: Did Ukraine open investigation into the Biden's Mr Morrison, not to my knowledge, ma'am. Ambassador Volker not to my knowledge either did either of you ever have any evidence of quid pro quo, Mr. Morrison ambassador, Volker. I did not any evidence of bribery. No ma'am. No, ma'am. Any evidence of treason? No ma'am no evidence of treason.

ELISE M. STEFANIK [03:42:25.059 - 03:42:45.420]: Without a deal back swell.

ERIC SWALWELL [03:42:46.170 - 03:43:02.145]: Thank you, Mr. Morrison did Ambassador Bolton want the security aide hold lifted. Yes, Congressman he did you testified that Ambassador Bolton had a one on one meeting with President Trump in late August related to Ukraine security assistance. Is that right, sir? Can you point to where I testified to that on Page 266 you said?

ERIC SWALWELL [03:43:02.145 - 03:43:18.120]: Ambassador Bolton had a one on one meeting with President Trump in late August 20, 19, But the President was not yet ready to approve the release of the assistants.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [03:43:18.120 - 03:43:28.110]: Do you remember that or was this -- this was to 26, yes, to 66 and to 68, but I'm asking you, did that happen or did it not?

PETER WELCH [03:43:28.520 - 03:43:38.070]: Sir, I just want to be -- I want to be clear characterizing it. OK?

ERIC SWALWELL [03:43:38.080 - 03:43:44.450]: Yes, sir, I see you testified to that. What was the outcome of that meeting between Ambassador Bolton and President Trump?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [03:43:44.560 - 03:43:53.500]: Ambassador Bolton did not yet believe the President was ready to approve the assistance. Did Ambassador Bolton inform you of any reason for the ongoing hold that stemmed from this meeting.

ERIC SWALWELL [03:43:53.500 - 03:44:21.080]: No sir Mr. Morrison. Do you consider yourself loyal to the President? Yes, sir and the President executes the foreign policy of the United States, is that right? Well, sir, I would say he decides to pull the foreign says it yes, sir. And as a staffer on the National Security Council and even someone who serves in the military, it's your job to faithfully execute the foreign policy priorities of the President is that right through my boat, my oath is to obey all lawful orders.

ERIC SWALWELL [03:44:21.080 - 03:44:48.660]: On July 25, you listen to the President, United States talk to the President of Ukraine, is that correct? July 25th? Yes, sir. And regardless of what you had prepared as far as talking points for that call for the President, you heard the President the United States ask the President of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Is that correct?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [03:44:50.190 - 03:44:51.220]: Yes, sir, he made a request.

ERIC SWALWELL [03:44:51.990 - 03:45:12.910]: And after the July 25 call between President Trump and the Ukrainian President, fair to say that you talked to your Ukrainian counterparts a number of times. Yes, sir, how many times when you talked to your Ukrainian counterpart counterparts, did you ask them to investigate the Bidens? Never sir, why not?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [03:45:15.790 - 03:45:19.440]: Sir, it was -- it was not a policy objective that I was aware of.

ERIC SWALWELL [03:45:19.600 - 03:45:33.560]: But with all due respect, Mr. Morrison, you're not in the White House to carry out your policy objectives. You just testified that the President sets the foreign policy objectives for the United States and the one call that you listen to between the President United States and the President of Ukraine, the President of the United States priorities were to investigate the Bidens. And I'm asking you, sir.

ERIC SWALWELL [03:45:33.560 - 03:45:47.520]: Why didn't you follow up on the President's priorities when you talked to the Ukrainians?

PETER WELCH [03:45:47.520 - 03:45:54.330]: Sir, I did not understand it as a policy objective. Mr. Morrison.

ERIC SWALWELL [03:45:54.330 - 03:46:17.110]: I know that you put that conversation in the server because as you said, you feared the political consequences and some other reasons that you gave. But you also chose to defy the President's request to not come here as others have like Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Bolton. And you have come here and you've been truthful and I appreciate that Mr. Morse and whether you acknowledge it publicly or not.

ERIC SWALWELL [03:46:17.110 - 03:46:39.890]: I believe that you knew that what the President asked the Ukrainians to do was wrong. And as you just described your duty is to follow the foreign policy priorities, the President, but to also only follow something that is a lawful order. And I don't think you believe that was a lawful order and that's why you did not follow up on those priorities.

ERIC SWALWELL [03:46:39.890 - 03:47:02.670]: Mr. Volcker, we've heard a lot today about this President being such an anti-corruption President. He really cared about fighting corruption is Russia, a corrupt country. We're talking about President Zelinsky, President Trump, President Trump is Russia, a corrupt country. Yes, it is. And President Trump has met a number of times in person with President Putin. Is that right?

ERIC SWALWELL [03:47:02.670 - 03:47:25.450]: Yes, a few times and he's had a number of phone calls with President Putin. Is that right? Yes. Is Turkey a corrupt country? Yes, I believe so. And just last week, despite their corruption at the White House President, Erdogan had an audience with the present United States. Is that correct? Yes, he did. Finally, Mr. Giuliani on May 9th told The New York Times President Trump basically knows what I'm doing.

ERIC SWALWELL [03:47:25.450 - 03:47:48.230]: As his lawyer, are you familiar with that statement to The New York Times? No, I'm not, but you agree as someone who has a lawyer sitting next to you that a lawyer acts on a client's behalf and only on a client's behalf. Is that right?

KURT VOLKER [03:47:48.230 - 03:48:01.070]: I believe that a lawyer acts on his client's behalf. I'm not sure about only on the client's behalf because I think as I understood Mayor Giuliani in this case, he was doing a lot that I considered to be on his own.

ERIC SWALWELL [03:48:01.070 - 03:48:10.620]: I did not believe he was always instructed and when he said we're not meddling in an election, we're meddling in an investigation. He didn't say I, He said we is that correct?

KURT VOLKER [03:48:10.640 - 03:48:13.990]: I am -- I'm taking that from the statement.

WILL HURD [03:48:14.030 - 03:48:30.830]: You'll back Mr. Herd, Mr. Morris and my colleague from California suggests he knows your opinions and your thoughts better than you do. Do you have anything he can give you the opportunity to respond? Do you have a response or want to give a response?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [03:48:30.830 - 03:48:45.325]: No sir, I heard the President make a request. I received no direction at any time to attempt to read a policy process different from what I laid out in my deposition. I was directed by Dr. Koppelman to launch an interagency process to ensure a unity of opinion in the interagency as to the importance of continuing security sector assistance and that's what I did.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [03:48:45.325 - 03:48:59.820]: I acted upon the direction I was given good copy.

WILL HURD [03:49:00.380 - 03:49:26.300]: Why we're with you Miss Mr. Morrison. Thanks for your testimony. You're clear in sober testimony today. Did you participate in or overhear any conversations about how political information collected by Ukraine on the Bidens would be used for political gain? No sir ambassador Volker same question. Did you participate in or overhear any conversations about how potential information collected by Ukraine on the Bidens would be used for political gain?

WILL HURD [03:49:26.300 - 03:49:52.220]: No, I did not. There's been a lot of discussions about a text exchange you had with Mr. your iMac on August 12th that talked about this proposed statement. And in Mayor Giuliani provided some feedback on what he thought needed to be included in that. Did Mayor Giuliani get feedback from the President on what should go into that proposed statement?

KURT VOLKER [03:49:52.220 - 03:49:55.590]: I have no reason to think that he had discussed it with the President.

WILL HURD [03:49:58.700 - 03:50:16.225]: Based on your recollection, Ambassador Volker, who within the Zelinsky regime has Mayor Giuliani interacted with now in addition to Mr. Mack, which we've already talked about and also the former attorney general of him having claimed that he met predecessor as prosecutor general now, but that's not within -- That's not under his own team that Whitman, which in which we're we're talking about. I don't know who else he would have met with in as few words as possible.

WILL HURD [03:50:16.225 - 03:50:33.750]: What was your understanding of Ambassador Sohn, last war in Ukraine?

KURT VOLKER [03:50:34.370 - 03:50:49.835]: He cared about Ukraine, he wanted to see U.S. support for Ukraine increased. He wanted to see European Union support for Ukraine increased including maintenance of sanctions and he wanted to be helpful was Ambassador songlines having conversations with senior Zelinsky officials without letting other people know.

KURT VOLKER [03:50:49.835 - 03:51:05.300]: I don't believe that he was not letting people know. I think he may have had some conversations, but I think he was just acting, you know, and I think we circled back quite frequently with myself.

WILL HURD [03:51:05.300 - 03:51:20.260]: Ambassador Taylor and others, can you say that you have a clear understanding of what Ambassador, Sunland and Mayor Giuliani were doing in all their interactions with Ukrainian officials? I can't say that I had a clear understanding.

KURT VOLKER [03:51:20.810 - 03:51:40.220]: I thought that Ambassador, Suleiman and I were working on the same objective, which is getting a meeting between President Zelinsky and President Trump and that is a statement as I understood it that mentioned Brisbane 2016 would be potentially helpful. I didn't know anything more about their interactions or what their thoughts?

WILL HURD [03:51:40.220 - 03:51:57.163]: You didn't have a clear understanding as the special Representative of Ukraine. Do you think the Ukrainians had a clear understanding? No, I don't. You thought there was a difference between Barisan and Biden in the 2016 election. Is that correct? That's correct. Do you think the Ukrainians had similar understanding?

WILL HURD [03:51:57.163 - 03:52:14.107]: Yes, I do. There's also a perception that when Ambassador you've of it, who we've all heard 33 years of being an awesome ambassador, that when she left keys that the U.S. position on corruption would weaken. That's kind of a narrative that's floating around. Who was the person that took over for her in the interim?

WILL HURD [03:52:14.107 - 03:52:31.050]: Who was the charg after immediately after masha, it was Joe Pennington was -- was this individual strong or weak on corruption?

KURT VOLKER [03:52:31.310 - 03:52:35.110]: I would say in line with all the rest of our policy.

WILL HURD [03:52:35.180 - 03:53:05.740]: And after that individual who was that person replaced with then that was Bill Taylor, who you suggested for for that decision was Ambassador Taylor strong or weak on corruption. Very strong Mr. Morrison in my last twenty three minutes who sets official U.S. policy. Sir. The President, not some other staffer within the NSC process or the NSC staff exists to ensure the President has the full array of options for his decision.

UNIDENTIFIED [03:53:05.760 - 03:53:09.780]: Thank you. I yield back Mr. Castro. Thank you, Chairman.

JOAQUIN CASTRO [03:53:09.810 - 03:53:34.580]: Thank you gentlemen for your testimony today. Is it correct to say that both you gentlemen or were either appointed or hired by the White House by the Trump administration? Yes, sir, in my case by Secretary Tillerson, but part of the Trump administration, yes, serving in the same administration, sure ambassador Volker, you previously testified that Ambassador Gordon Sunlen quote. I just know that he had a relationship with President Trump that I did not have. In fact, in one text message dated July 26, You wrote to Ambassador Sunlen quote, great photo Gordon.

JOAQUIN CASTRO [03:53:34.580 - 03:53:59.350]: Can you get this to post without intermediaries? July 26 was the same day that Ambassador Sunlen spoke to the President from a restaurant Kiev said, right?

KURT VOLKER [03:54:00.360 - 03:54:05.910]: So the date again, July 26, Yes, that I know that to be correct now.

JOAQUIN CASTRO [03:54:05.990 - 03:54:19.630]: Were you aware of that call? No, I was not. Well, this committee certainly is aware of it now as we all are were you aware that Ambassador Sunland had a direct line to the President, he claims that he spoke to the President frequently.

KURT VOLKER [03:54:19.690 - 03:54:29.870]: Did you have reason to doubt that Ambassador Solon's a big personality and sometimes says things that might be a bit bigger than life?

JOAQUIN CASTRO [03:54:29.880 - 03:54:52.020]: He too, he was a political appointee. He was handpicked by the President or somebody in the President's administration to serve in his position. And I believe that he could speak with the President. He had also been a large donor to one of Trump's President Trump's campaign. Committees, is that correct? I have learned that Mr. Morris and you stated during your testimony that when you met Ambassador Sunlen for the first time, he represented that quote his mandate from the President was to go make deals. And in fact, you testified that between July 25th and September 11th of this year, you heard or learned that Ambassador Sunlen and President Trump spoke on several occasions.

JOAQUIN CASTRO [03:54:52.020 - 03:55:14.160]: Is it accurate that every time you checked, you were able to confirm that Ambassador Sunland had in fact spoken to the President? Yes, Congressman Mr. Morrison, you also testified that Ambassador Sunlen emailed you and several White House staff to say that he briefed President Trump in advance of his July 25th call with Ukrainian President.

JOAQUIN CASTRO [03:55:14.160 - 03:55:36.300]: Is that correct? Yes. Congressman did Ambassador Sunlen tell you what he briefed the President all.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [03:55:36.810 - 03:55:41.160]: It was -- he sent me an e-mail, sir. It was a very succinct.

JOAQUIN CASTRO [03:55:41.160 - 03:56:04.840]: It was a list of three items as a very succinct item. With respect to Ukraine, I briefed the President on the call and you testify that you personally confirmed that Ambassador Sunland and President Trump had spoken before the July 25th call. That is correct. Congressman and presumably the White House situation room keeps a record of those calls, sir.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [03:56:04.840 - 03:56:07.230]: That is how I was able to confirm it.

JOAQUIN CASTRO [03:56:07.270 - 03:56:33.528]: OK. You separately testify that your staff prepared a briefing memo, which suggested points for the President to raise on July 25th points that were consistent with U.S. policy. Is that correct? Correct? Congressman, but the President didn't use those points. Did he? No sir, he did not. So I guess let me get this straight.

JOAQUIN CASTRO [03:56:33.528 - 03:56:59.785]: You prepared materials for the President, your prepare your materials did not include references to Biden or the 2016 election set, right, right? Congressman. And then Ambassador Sunlen, the guy who is the Gordon problem, the guy who's got a direct link to the President, the guy who's talking about making deals brief President Trump, right.

JOAQUIN CASTRO [03:56:59.785 - 03:57:26.043]: Correct Congressman and then President Trump raised the 2016 election and Vice President Biden and his son to the Ukrainian President after he was briefed by Ambassador Sunlen. Right, right? So it sounds like Ambassador Sunlen and the President were on the same page. They both are working to benefit the President's personal political interest.

JOAQUIN CASTRO [03:57:26.043 - 03:57:52.300]: Even when that undermined U.S. foreign policy, I want to ask you in the short time that I have both you gentlemen who serve the United States government, whether putting President Trump aside, whether you believe that it's proper for any President now or later to ask a foreign Government to investigate a U.S. citizen and specifically a U.S. citizen that could be a political rival ambassador. I don't believe it is appropriate for the President to do that if we have law enforcement concerns with a U.S. citizen.

KURT VOLKER [03:57:52.310 - 03:57:56.250]: Generally, there are appropriate channels for that. Mr. Morrison.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [03:57:56.290 - 03:57:59.380]: I agree with Ambassador, Paul Volcker, sir.

JOHN RATCLIFFE [03:57:59.470 - 03:58:09.590]: Thank you, Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Arthur, thank you. Chairman, Gentlemen, I appreciate both of you being here today. I know it's been a long day for you.

UNIDENTIFIED [03:58:10.110 - 03:58:16.560]: Mr. Morrison, I'm gonna try and summarize some of what we've heard to shorten this.

JOHN RATCLIFFE [03:58:16.560 - 03:58:36.065]: You were on the July 25th call, Colonel Andrews on the July 25th call, correct? Yes, Congressman and I will tell you that he testified earlier today that he heard what he thought was a demand on that call that was improper and felt that he had a duty to report that I think we've established already that he did not discuss or report Any of that to you?

JOHN RATCLIFFE [03:58:36.065 - 03:58:55.570]: Correct, yes, Congressman, but you did have a discussion with Colonel Veneman about other concerns that he had with the call. And I believe you said the fidelity of the translation and the fact that you both shared a discussion about not there not being a full throated embrace of the Ukrainian reform agenda.

JOHN RATCLIFFE [03:58:55.570 - 03:59:15.075]: Is that fair? Yes, Congressman okay, But with respect to his concern about something improper specifically at no point, did he come to you and say I heard something that I thought was improper and was a crime, sir. I have no recollection of him doing that. O'BRIEN, No extortion, no quid pro quo, all the things that Mr. Dyke asked you.

JOHN RATCLIFFE [03:59:15.075 - 03:59:34.580]: No, sir, all right. And as you were listening, Did you hear President Trump make a demand of anything that would constitute a crime?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [03:59:37.000 - 03:59:42.370]: Sir, I've been trying to stay on the safe side of making legal conclusions, but -- but no, sir, I did not hear him make any sort of demand.

JOHN RATCLIFFE [03:59:42.700 - 04:00:01.440]: You have a law degree I do, sir. So you're at least generally familiar with bribery and extortion generally. I'm not a lawyer for the United States, all right. But is it fair to say that as you were listening to the call, you weren't thinking while the President's President is bribing the President of Ukraine that never crossed your mind?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [04:00:01.450 - 04:00:09.450]: It did not sir or that he was extorting the President of Ukraine. It's not sir or doing anything improper, correct, sir, right?

JOHN RATCLIFFE [04:00:09.610 - 04:00:24.390]: And have you heard or read in the media where President Zelinsky agrees with you and said repeatedly and consistently that he didn't hear any demand, he didn't hear any conditions. He didn't feel any pressure. He didn't experience anything improper or corrupt on the call.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [04:00:24.400 - 04:00:31.080]: Sir, I attended the bilat in New York at the U.N. General Assembly and he made clear at the time in front of the press that he felt no pressure.

JOHN RATCLIFFE [04:00:31.210 - 04:01:02.645]: So did anyone on the National Security Council after this call expressed to you that some crime, bribery extortion, quid pro quo, anything had occurred? No, sir, I want to ask you Mr. Lawson about the whistleblower complaint. I don't want to ask you to speculate as to the identity, but I want to ask you about the accusations that started this as to their veracity.

JOHN RATCLIFFE [04:01:02.645 - 04:01:34.080]: First of all, the whistleblower who apparently was not on the call, advised the ICG that he or she was concerned that the President's conduct constituted under Title 50, USC Section 30, 33 quote a serious problem abuse or violation of law or executive order end quote. Again, to be clear, you didn't hear a violation of law or executive order as you listen to the call.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [04:01:34.140 - 04:01:37.680]: Sir, I made no judgment about any illegal conduct occurring.

JOHN RATCLIFFE [04:01:37.680 - 04:01:53.363]: The whistleblower also reported in starting this inquiry asserted that the President, President Trump quote sought to pressure the Ukrainian leadership to take actions to help the President's 2020 re-election bid President Trump does not mention 2020 during the call. Does he? No sir, I don't believe he did.

JOHN RATCLIFFE [04:01:53.363 - 04:02:09.047]: President Trump doesn't mention his re-election bid during the call. Does he sir? I don't believe he did and you did not hear President Trump pressure or have a demand of any kind as we've already established. Correct, correct sir. Whistleblowers like Colonel Denman also uses the word demand. Did you say a whistleblower like Colonel Newman?

JOHN RATCLIFFE [04:02:09.047 - 04:02:24.730]: I don't think that's a fact.

KURT VOLKER [04:02:27.770 - 04:02:38.070]: Counsel, you should use a microphone. Thank you. I'm sorry. Nobody respects it. I always -- when I believe you just said, a whistleblower like Colonel Vann may know I said, I'm sorry. Thank God, yeah.

JOHN RATCLIFFE [04:02:38.100 - 04:02:54.995]: The whistleblower like Colonel Min, Vin Man also uses the word demand on page 4, whistleblower asserted, quote, Ambassador, Volker and Sunland. Purportedly provided advice to Ukrainian leadership about how to navigate the demands the President had made of Mr. Zelinsky end quote. Again, there were no demands from your perspective, Mr. Morrison?

JOHN RATCLIFFE [04:02:54.995 - 04:03:11.890]: That is correct, sir. All right, so speculations about the whistleblower aside with regard to motivations. The fact is that the whistleblower was wrong about many of the facts as well.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [04:03:15.590 - 04:03:20.840]: As Sir I'm not intimately familiar with a whistleblower complaint, but I did not hear a demand on that call.

UNIDENTIFIED [04:03:20.840 - 04:03:29.800]: I feel that the gentleman has expired Mr. thank you, Mr. Chairman.

DENNY HECK [04:03:29.800 - 04:03:51.587]: Ambassador Volker, I want to thank you for being here today and I frankly found some of your opening statement to be not just genuine but downright eloquent. In particular, I noted the passages about pushing back on Russian aggression and supporting the development of a strong, resilient democratic and prosperous Ukraine, one that overcomes a legacy of corruption and that this is critically important for U.S. national security.

DENNY HECK [04:03:51.587 - 04:04:13.373]: Some of us believe that we're not pushing back strongly enough on Russia. Some of us believe we're not being supportive enough of the Ukraine, but one of our challenges is to go home to the people for whom we work and help explain to them why it is in our national security interest. You have an audience like you'll never have.

DENNY HECK [04:04:13.373 - 04:04:35.160]: But again, it's to look into the camera and tell the American public why it is important to support Ukraine, why it should matter to them if the biggest issue in their life is getting their kids off to school, paying their bills and the like, Sir. Thank you. So much Congressman.

KURT VOLKER [04:04:35.390 - 04:04:54.860]: I agree with you completely that we are not pushing back hard enough on Russia and that we owe Ukraine a great deal of support. Why does it matter? Russia is trying to up and security in Europe. It's trying to reassert its domination of neighboring countries, whether it's Georgia or Ukraine or the Baltic states.

KURT VOLKER [04:04:54.860 - 04:05:14.330]: It has led to war in Europe. The war in Ukraine has left more people dead in Europe and a European war than anything since the Balkans. More people displaced by a war in Europe since anything since World War 2. These are people who stand up for freedom, for democracy, they want reform, they want to see their country be successful like Germany and like Sweden like us and they are fighting a war of aggression against them, designed to hold them back.

KURT VOLKER [04:05:14.330 - 04:05:33.800]: And if we want to live in a world of freedom for the United States, we ought to be supporting freedom for people around the world.

DENNY HECK [04:05:35.460 - 04:05:59.520]: Thank you for that. So we're here in part because under cover of a concern for general corruption, some of us believe there wasn't. In fact there was something quite nefarious as the alternative that there wasn't a concern about general corruption. But reviewing the record on that, sir, is it not true that in March of this year, the Department of Defense certified Ukraine as having been sufficient had made sufficient progress to continue to receive military assistance.

DENNY HECK [04:05:59.520 - 04:06:23.580]: I don't know the details of that, but I believe that to -- because it's not true that on April 21st, President Zelinsky won an overwhelming mandate with 73 percent of the vote based largely on his effort and advocacy for anti-corruption. That is correct. Is it not true that this mandate was affirmed and expanded on July 21st when his party won one party control again on the basis of anti-corruption?

DENNY HECK [04:06:23.580 - 04:06:47.640]: That is correct. In fact subsequently he enacted sweeping reforms to combat anti-corruption. Did he not? Yes, he has. And is it not true that everybody on the ground thought or was filled with optimism that Ukraine was getting serious about combating corruption? That is correct. Ambassador Volker did you know that one of the very first anti-corruption measures passed in Ukraine was a lot to provide for the impeachment of the President?

DENNY HECK [04:06:47.640 - 04:07:11.700]: I did not know that it's true because he thought we should start with its himself. I raised this because my friends on the other side of the aisle keep characterizing this impeachment. Inquiry is inherently wrong because and I'm quoting them, it will overturn an election over and over or will overturn an election.

DENNY HECK [04:07:11.700 - 04:07:35.760]: Will impeachment is an anti-corruption tool in four by France on the other side of aisle, yes, it does overturn an election by definition. It overturns an election. I don't know if they've got a problem with their constitution or its provisions for impeachment, but I recommend they reread the relevance passages in Article 1 sections 2 and 3 in some of the history about how we got there.

DENNY HECK [04:07:35.760 - 04:07:59.820]: Look, none of us wants to be here despite what's being said, none of us came to this easily. I didn't -- there were a call for the rest of my life. The 48 hours I spent at our family cabin literally plunged in self reflection and literally prayerful deliberation about this whole matter. Collectively, we're going to have to grapple with this very grave decision.

DENNY HECK [04:07:59.820 - 04:08:23.880]: It's weighty and it's going to get hard and it's hard in proportion to its importance to our great republic, a republic if we can keep it yield back. Mr. Chairman?

JIM JORDAN [04:08:25.360 - 04:08:41.547]: Mr. Jordan, thank you, Mr. Chairman, ambassador Volker in the now famous call transcript the bottom of page three. President Trump said this. I heard you had a prosecutor and he was shut down and that's really unfair. I just asked for clarification, do you believe President Trump was talking about Luis Cinco or shocking shocking shocking?

JIM JORDAN [04:08:41.547 - 04:08:57.733]: No, it's all right. Thank you so much. That's what I thought as well. Mr. Morrison, you testified in your deposition that you had issues with Colonel Benjamin's judgment. Is that right? It is sir. And you said you specifically that you had concerns with Colonel vim in exercising quote, appropriate judgment as to whom he said what?

JIM JORDAN [04:08:57.733 - 04:09:13.920]: Is that right? It is sir. You testified that Dr. Hill, your predecessor at NSC told you that she had concerns about Colonel Vinson, Vinson's judgment. Is that right? It is sir. And you testify that Colonel Denton did not always adhere to the chain of command. Is that right, I believe so, yes, sir.

UNIDENTIFIED [04:09:13.920 - 04:09:19.070]: You testified that you were aware of issues with Colonel them and trying to access information outside his lane. Is that correct, sir?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [04:09:19.170 - 04:09:28.990]: I believe I stated that I was aware that there were those who were concerned about that. Yes, sir, thank you. You testified that Colonel Dinh though was not included on certain trips. Is that right? Yes, sir.

JIM JORDAN [04:09:29.010 - 04:09:52.125]: And you testified that colleagues expressed concerns to you about Colonel Denman leaking information. Is that right? Yes sir. Now when I asked Colonel Lemon why he didn't go to you with his concerns about the call, even though you -- his boss had no concerns about anything being I think your language was nothing improper, nothing illegal on the call.

JIM JORDAN [04:09:52.125 - 04:10:15.240]: I asked Colonel Denton earlier this morning why he didn't go to you and instead went and talked to the lawyers, his brother, Secretary Kent and one other person that he wouldn't tell us and chairmanship wouldn't allow him to tell us when I asked him why he did That he indicated that the lawyers had instructed him to do that and he tried to get a hold of you. Is that -- is that fair?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [04:10:15.270 - 04:10:19.540]: Sir, I watched part of the proceedings this morning. I heard him say that. Yes, sir.

JIM JORDAN [04:10:19.660 - 04:10:46.360]: OK. Well, one thing that chairmanship brought up at the end of this morning's hearing, he said he pointed out that you Colonel Edmonds boss also went to the lawyers, but your reason for going to the lawyers was a little different, wasn't it? Yes, sir. Yeah. I think you had a few things that Mr. Castro and you talked about earlier in today's hearing, but I think at the top of your list was you were concerned about the contents of the call leaking out.

UNIDENTIFIED [04:10:46.380 - 04:10:55.240]: Is that fair? Yes, sir, and that's exactly what happened. Isn't it, sir? I don't know.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [04:10:57.900 - 04:11:01.750]: I don't know that the contents leaked out. There was a whistleblower complaint.

JIM JORDAN [04:11:01.830 - 04:11:26.378]: The President chose to declassify the memo on -- well, it seems to me you were prophetic Mr Morrison because you said in your statement today, as I stated during my deposition, I feared at the time of the call on July 25th, how the disclosure of the contents of The call would play in Washington's political climate.

JIM JORDAN [04:11:26.378 - 04:11:50.925]: My fears have been realized, seems to me you, you saw what might happen and it sure enough did fair to say yes, sir. And we get all this. I mean we get all this and that's the part of it. That's the part that gets me. We get all this, these hearings these weeks, the basement in the bunker, in the basement of the Capitol and four facts that we keep coming back to have never changed will never change.

JIM JORDAN [04:11:50.925 - 04:12:15.473]: We've heard from both of you today confirm these fundamental facts. We got the call transcript as you both said no linkage to security assistance dollars and investigations and the call transcript. We've got the two individuals who were on the call. They've both said no linkage, no pressure. No pushing, we've got the fact that the Ukrainians didn't even know aid had been withheld until August 29 And most importantly the Ukrainians did nothing as far as starting promising to start announcing they were going to start investigation did nothing and they got released. I believe it got released because of what we've been talking about.

JIM JORDAN [04:12:15.473 - 04:12:40.020]: Good work, Mr. -- excuse me, Ambassador Volker and others, I believe that's why it happened and yet here we are.

K. MICHAEL CONAWAY [04:12:40.030 - 04:12:48.160]: And you -- you called it all, you saw this coming, that's why you went to the lawyers. That's why you wanted to.

JIM JORDAN [04:12:48.320 - 04:12:56.040]: That's why the concern was there and that's the part that's most troubling I yield back. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.

UNIDENTIFIED [04:12:56.150 - 04:13:14.150]: Ambassador Volker on Daily Mail, they currently have this headline, it says Ukraine special envoy. Kurt Volker walks back his closed door testimony and says he quote has now learned there was a link between U.S. military aid and a Biden probe. That's not your testimony today, is it?

MICHAEL R. TURNER [04:13:14.150 - 04:13:17.320]: I don't believe that's in my testimony. Thank you. You bet.

PETER WELCH [04:13:19.810 - 04:14:02.730]: Mr. Welch, thank you. Just following up on Mr. Jordan, easiest way to avoid investigation is to not do anything wrong. I want to talk a little bit about why we're here. Official government actions can't be traded for help in a political campaign. Let me give an analogy and ask each of you if you agree could a mayor of a city withhold funding for the police department budget unless the police chief agreed to open up an investigation on a political rival. Mr. Morrison.

UNIDENTIFIED [04:14:03.040 - 04:14:10.200]: In that hypothetical, No, I don't think you should do that. Yeah, and Mr. Vole or Ambassador Volker, sure you agree, yes.

PETER WELCH [04:14:10.290 - 04:14:39.733]: And the same would be true if it were a governor withholding the budget request to the state police unless the state police agreed to conduct an investigation on a political rival, you would agree, correct. Yes, sir, in your view, is it any different for a member of Congress? Of course, not right. Would you agree that the President has the same obligation as the mayor as the governor as the member of Congress to not withhold aid unless he gets an investigation into a political rival?

PETER WELCH [04:14:39.733 - 04:15:09.177]: Mr Morrison. Yes, sir, I would agree with that hypothetical. I would agree. Thanks. And we're having a debate here both sides as to how to read what's plainly before us, the Presidential phone call, where the President ignored the work of the advisors and the National Security Council talking points instead chose to talk about the Bidens and talk about Hunter Biden. And ask for an investigation.

PETER WELCH [04:15:09.177 - 04:15:38.620]: So we are just going to have to debate that, but isn't the principle that no person including the President is above the law, absolutely essential and worth the effort to make certain that we continue to guarantee Ambassador Morrison.

UNIDENTIFIED [04:15:38.660 - 04:15:48.430]: Sir, I haven't been -- I'm sorry, Ambassador Volker, I'm sorry, pardon, yes. Yeah, Mr. Morrison sir. The rule of law is central to our democracy.

PETER WELCH [04:15:48.440 - 04:16:14.475]: It's so true, you know, we've had some discussions and challenge from the other side that the President has authority in foreign policy to do what he likes. And in fact, he does, you know a recent President by President Trump to take our troops out of Syria and allow the Turkish forces to go in literally meant that some Kurdish families went to bed Saturday night and woke up Sunday morning packed their kids and fled. For their lives?

PETER WELCH [04:16:14.475 - 04:16:40.510]: A lot of people, including both sides of the aisle, totally disagreed with that, but the President has the authority to do it impulsive. As that decision may have been unwise as it may have been as threatening to our national security. We're not talking about that here and Ambassador Volker. I've listened to your testimony and I take it in. Thank you for making efforts to try to advance what had been a bipartisan Ukraine policy.

PETER WELCH [04:16:40.510 - 04:17:06.545]: Help Ukraine get rid of corruption, help resist Russian aggression, but what you came to learn painfully is that there was a sidebar Ukraine policy with Giuliani as the advocate and it appears Ambassador Sunland is very much involved. Is that correct? I don't know everything about that sir. You don't, But as you have been involved in with the benefit of hindsight, while you were working on what you thought was stopping aggression and ending in eliminating corruption, there was a side deal here to get investigations going.

PETER WELCH [04:17:06.545 - 04:17:32.580]: Correct?

KURT VOLKER [04:17:32.800 - 04:17:50.120]: So yes, sir, my objective was purely focused on support for Ukraine national security and I now have learned through other testimony about the President's statement about investigating Biden and other conversations that I did not know about right.

PETER WELCH [04:17:50.590 - 04:18:09.495]: Thank you for that and thank you for your candor about Vice President Biden's, integrity and service. But the bottom line here is at the end of the day, we're going to have to make a judgment about what the President was up to with respect to that request. For the favor and how it repudiated the policy that was the bipartisan effort in Ukraine and raises questions about he in that hypothetical example I gave of the mayor held himself to be above the law.

PETER WELCH [04:18:09.495 - 04:18:28.400]: I yield back Maloney.

SEAN MALONEY [04:18:28.420 - 04:18:46.360]: Gentlemen, thank you for being here. Ambassador Volker struck by your opening statement, you moved a long way from the testimony you presented to us in October. And I know you gave a reason for that, which is that you were in the dark about a lot of these things.

KURT VOLKER [04:18:46.360 - 04:18:53.600]: Is that fair to say that is one things that I learned a lot out of the testimony, learned a lot?

SEAN MALONEY [04:18:53.890 - 04:19:08.810]: You learned a lot and what you said on page eight, I'm referring to your statement that you gave this morning, TV this afternoon that I did not know this quoting. I did not know that President Trump or others had raised vice President Biden with Ukrainians or had conflated the investigation of possible Ukrainian corruption with investigation of the former Vice President Biden.

SEAN MALONEY [04:19:08.810 - 04:19:23.730]: Right, correct, you didn't know Boris mom and Biden, that's what you're saying, right? I had separated the two. I got it. Well, you didn't know right. I mean you were -- you were well what you do, we have to go through it, sir. I mean, you were -- you were there on May 20. Third for the meeting with the President when he said talk to Rudy and Rudy short cared about the investigations, which you now know meant by right.

SEAN MALONEY [04:19:23.730 - 04:19:38.650]: But you missed it on May 20th, third, right?

KURT VOLKER [04:19:38.650 - 04:19:46.810]: No sir, I understood at the time that one hundred Biden and Vice President, Biden's son had been a board member.

SEAN MALONEY [04:19:47.020 - 04:20:03.712]: I understand, but you didn't read that as as a request to investigate the Biden's at that time. That's all I'm saying, correct. And on July 10th, you were in not one but two meetings in the White House where Ambassador Scotland raised the investigations, but you didn't know was about the Biden's. That's your testimony, right?

SEAN MALONEY [04:20:03.712 - 04:20:20.404]: At the time I did not think he was talking about anything, right? You heard him say investigation, you thought it was inappropriate and the chairman asked you about that. But you said, oh, it's because I didn't know was the Biden's. I just thought it was inappropriate. And then I guess when they were in the ward room and in and Ambassador online raised Boris mind the Bidens in 2016, you missed that too as I understand it, that is correct.

SEAN MALONEY [04:20:20.404 - 04:20:37.096]: Right, and then of course, on July 18th, he knew aid was withheld. And then in August, you spent a good part of the time with this statement with Rudy Giuliani, right? I mean, you were the guy making the changes and interacted with Ukrainians. You were putting in Rudy's changes, which included a call for investigating charisma and the 2016 elections, which you now know meant Biden's, Right?

SEAN MALONEY [04:20:37.096 - 04:20:53.788]: You didn't know it at the time, right, but now we know it right. And then on September 1st, you were in Warsaw. I mean you were at every point this you were in Warsaw and you were there when Ambassador Sunland told Andre, your Mac that he was not going to get security assistance. He wasn't going to get a White House meeting unless there was the investigation.

SEAN MALONEY [04:20:53.788 - 04:21:10.480]: And I understand you missed that, you were out of the loop, then that's not correct, sir. So I was not in Warsaw at these meetings.

KURT VOLKER [04:21:10.570 - 04:21:21.900]: Oh, excuse me, you were not a worse, but you heard about it right after from Scotland. Is that right? No, that's not quite correct either. It was sometime later I got it. So -- but now we know right now you know what it meant.

SEAN MALONEY [04:21:22.180 - 04:21:29.710]: And you said in retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently and had I done so I would have raised my own objections, right? That is correct.

KURT VOLKER [04:21:29.710 - 04:21:44.635]: And what are the objections you would have raised, sir, that people what I would have raised is that people are conflating, investigating the Bidens with investigating these Ukrainian, but would you have objected to the President asking for an investigation of the Bidens as you sit here now, You said I would have raised my own objections.

KURT VOLKER [04:21:44.635 - 04:21:59.560]: Yes, if you knew it was the Biden's, if I knew we were talking about investigating Vice President Biden and asking the Ukrainians and is that that would be -- that would be inappropriate and I would have objected to that right and when.

SEAN MALONEY [04:21:59.560 - 04:22:25.600]: And so if you had heard him ask for it on the call and you said in retrospect, Ukrainians clearly would have been -- it would have been confusing, right? Correct is confusing the right word, sir. I mean, it would have put them in the position of having to do something inappropriate right known as the gate. The Biden, I think confusing is the right word because they were clearly hearing something different from the President in one conversation and different from me. As a U.S. special Representative developer, maybe certain they understood that investigating Berrimah and investigating 2016 in fact meant the Bidens even though you didn't. I mean, in fact at the time you were talking to your Mac and putting those changes in the statement, he had talked to Sunlen right at the same time.

SEAN MALONEY [04:22:25.600 - 04:22:51.640]: And so the point being that they were put in an impossible position, they were being asked to do something inappropriate and you now know that right and you would have -- you would have raised your own objection.

KURT VOLKER [04:22:51.640 - 04:23:07.730]: I know they were asked in the phone call to do that in the conversations that I had with the Ukrainians, we were not asking them to do that. And even at that point, the Ukrainians perhaps with knowledge of this phone call, which I did not have knowledge of at the time said we just don't want to go there.

SEAN MALONEY [04:23:07.840 - 04:23:20.935]: Right and so, so in retrospect though, you would have raised objections, she would have said it was inappropriate for the President, correct to do this. And Mr. Morrison, can I just ask you, sir? So you -- I'm stuck -- I'm stuck on this issue of -- of you didn't see anything wrong with the call, but you went straight to NSC legal to report it. Is that your testimony to us today?

SEAN MALONEY [04:23:20.935 - 04:23:34.030]: Yes, sir, thank you sir. You bet. Islamics.

VAL B. DEMINGS [04:23:34.070 - 04:24:00.450]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Morrison and to both of you. Thank you so much for your service. Thanks for being here. It's been a long day. Mr. Morrison, just to follow up on the question from my colleague, you responded earlier to a series of questions about the call and basically saw nothing wrong with it yet you skipped your chain of command to go to legal counsel to find out I guess to find Out what to do because you were concerned about the political fallout, not about anything being inappropriate or wrong with the call, is that correct?

VAL B. DEMINGS [04:24:00.450 - 04:24:26.830]: Ma'am, I don't agree with the premise, no. okay. Could you tell me why you felt the need? You saw nothing basically wrong with the call, yet you skipped your chain of command to go to counsel because of what -- what was the reason for that?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [04:24:26.830 - 04:24:35.990]: I don't know that I -- again I don't agree with the premise, ma'am. I don't think -- I didn't skip my chain of command. If I had seen something wrong, I would have. Who are you? Who is your direct report?

VAL B. DEMINGS [04:24:37.100 - 04:24:52.820]: The deputy national Cruz advisor and the name of the person Dr. Charles Koppelman, I think Dr. Cooperman, did you speak with him before you spoke with legal counsel? No, No ma'am, but you don't feel you skipped your chain of command in doing so going directly to counsel.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [04:24:52.860 - 04:25:18.270]: Ma'am, if I may, I viewed my engagement with the NSC legal adviser as one largely focused on administrative matters. I was interested in locking down the traNSCript fancied administrative matter. I was interested in making sure that the legal adviser was aware of the call because I didn't see anybody from the legal advisors office and why were you so concerned about the legal adviser being aware of this call that you saw nothing basically wrong with the substance? Or content of the call, because I did not see anybody from the advisors office in the listening room and I wanted to make sure somebody from the legal advisors office was aware and I wanted to make sure it was a senior person.

TIMOTHY MORRISON [04:25:18.270 - 04:25:43.680]: What is it that you wanted them to be aware of specifically, I wanted them to be aware of the call because I -- I wanted them to know what had transpired.

VAL B. DEMINGS [04:25:45.430 - 04:25:55.610]: What concerned you to the point where you wanted them to know what had transpired that you went directly to legal counsel to inform them of?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [04:25:55.820 - 04:26:07.150]: My my equivalent to the head of NSC Weigl was -- wasn't is John Eisenberg, he was -- he was my equivalent in that position. I wouldn't go to somebody subordinate to him. I would go to.

VAL B. DEMINGS [04:26:07.160 - 04:26:21.490]: Didn't you testify earlier that you were concerned about the political fallout? I was a star on the political climate in DC, Just met this man. Okay all right. And so how long have you supervised Lieutenant Colonel Denman?

TIMOTHY MORRISON [04:26:23.170 - 04:26:29.400]: Ma'am, approximately August night, approximately July 15 to October 31 or so.

VAL B. DEMINGS [04:26:30.200 - 04:26:43.970]: All right, thank you. Ambassador Volker, you testified that you believe Congressional pressure helped unfreeze the security assistance being released. Do you still stand by that testimony today?

KURT VOLKER [04:26:43.970 - 04:27:02.270]: I believe it was important I met with staff members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I then saw the letter that several Senators signed and sent to Chief of Staff Mulvaney and I was briefed about the possibility of a couple of phone calls from some senior members of the Senate as well. Thank you.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:27:02.270 - 04:27:26.820]: Mr. Chairman, I yield my remaining time to you. I think the general feeling investor Volcker, just want to follow on a couple of questions about Ukrainians not being aware of the aid being withheld. You're aware I'm sure of the testimony of Colonel Lindeman that in fact he was contacted by someone within the Ukrainian embassy who is concerned about the whole prior to its becoming public.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:27:26.820 - 04:27:51.370]: I was not aware of that, but I take that. Are you aware of Ms Crofts testimony and transcripts that have been released that in fact Ukrainians found out quite quickly after the hold was placed in July that she was impressed with Ukrainian tradecraft and that the Iranians had a reason to keep it silent, not make it Public?

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:27:51.370 - 04:28:15.920]: I saw that in her testimony, you don't have any reason to question whether in fact that testimony is accurate. No, I don't. So the Ukrainians did find out before it was public at least according to these two witnesses, but nevertheless Ukrainian certainly found out it was public. When it was published in the newspaper, right?

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:28:15.920 - 04:28:40.470]: That is correct in August 28 And at the time they found out from the newspaper, they still hadn't had the White House meeting and they still didn't have the aid. And at that point, they had already had the conversation with the President in which she asked them to investigate the Bidens, correct? That is correct, Mr. Krishnamurthy.

RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI [04:28:40.710 - 04:29:05.783]: Good evening to both of you and thank you for your service ambassador Volker on page seven of your opening statement today. You said since events surrounding your earlier testimony October 3rd, quote unquote a great deal of additional information perspectives have come to light. I have learned many things that I did not know at the time of the events in question, correct?

RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI [04:29:05.783 - 04:29:30.857]: Yes, that is correct. That includes conversations that occurred as well as meetings that occurred of which you weren't apart part, correct, correct, sir, you obviously were not a part of the July 25th call, is that right? That is correct. You were not aware that Ambassador Sumlin according to your opening statement, had a call with President Trump on July 26, correct?

RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI [04:29:30.857 - 04:29:55.930]: That is correct on September 1st you weren't present for the sidebar meeting between Ambassador Sunland and special advisor. Your is that right? That is correct and you certainly weren't part of the phone call between Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Sunland in which Ambassador, Sunlen according to multiple multiple people now said that everything a white house meeting as well as military aid were dependent on public announcements of investigations.

RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI [04:29:55.930 - 04:30:21.003]: Isn't that right? That is correct and certainly sir, you weren't part of the phone call on September 7th between Ambassador Sunland and President Trump in which President Trump insisted that President Zelinsky go to a mike and publicly announced investigations of President Trump's domestic rivals and that right.

RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI [04:30:21.003 - 04:30:46.077]: Correct and certainly you weren't part of the September 8th phone call between Ambassador Sunland and Ambassador Trump -- I'm sorry, President Trump where President Trump again insists that these announcements have to happen. Is that right? That is correct, sir. You say that you weren't a witness to any kind of quid pro quo or conditionality between military assistance and investigations, what someone called missiles for misinformation today?

RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI [04:30:46.077 - 04:31:11.150]: Isn't that right? That is correct, but sir, you weren't present for many, if not all of the phone calls and conversations were these alleged instances of quid pro quo occurred, is that right?

PETER WELCH [04:31:11.150 - 04:31:11.840]: That is correct.

RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI [04:31:13.370 - 04:31:28.993]: Sir, let me turn your attention to another topic that's come up today. I actually came up last Friday, you have high regard for Ambassador Jovanovic, correct? Yes, I do. I presume that you were aware that as the ambassador was testifying President Trump actually tweeted very disparaging remarks about her, right?

RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI [04:31:28.993 - 04:31:44.617]: I saw that moment and I presume that you disapprove of those types of tweets, correct? I don't think that's appropriate. You've supervised many, many people over the years during your career in the foreign service, right? Yes, I have and you would never do that to one of your direct reports or anybody who worked in your organization, right?

RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI [04:31:44.617 - 04:32:00.240]: No, I would not -- it's just wrong.

KURT VOLKER [04:32:01.310 - 04:32:07.650]: I believe that even when you feel like you need to criticize criticism as private praise as public.

RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI [04:32:07.850 - 04:32:21.020]: And I also believe that you're a man of honor and you would not attack a veteran, you would not attack someone who is currently serving in the military who is doing their duty, correct?

KURT VOLKER [04:32:21.050 - 04:32:23.750]: I respect the service of our members in uniform.

RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI [04:32:23.780 - 04:32:44.960]: In fact, there is a certain man that we both admire the late Senator John McCain, yes, who unfortunately was attacked not only when he was alive but after he died by the current President. Isn't that right? That is true. And I presume that you would disapprove of all of those attacks on John McCain, right?

KURT VOLKER [04:32:45.000 - 04:32:53.910]: Yes, I know John, I knew John McCain very, very well for a very long time. He's an honorable man and very much a war hero for this country.

RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI [04:32:53.920 - 04:33:16.460]: Well, today, sir, as Lieutenant Colonel Inman was testifying our President, used the official Twitter account of the Office of the President to attack Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin's credibility, I presume you don't approve of those types of tweets either do you?

KURT VOLKER [04:33:16.460 - 04:33:25.210]: I was not aware of that and as with Ambassador Jovanovic, it's not appropriate. Thank you, sir. Thank you for your service and thank you Mr. Morrison for yours as well.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:33:27.440 - 04:33:32.120]: That concludes the member questioning. I now recognize ranking member for any closing comments he has.

DEVIN NUNES [04:33:33.440 - 04:33:56.754]: Thank you. As the first day of this week's impeachment TV marathon draws to a close, I'd like to remind the American people what we're watching public hearings are the culmination of three years of incessant Democrat efforts to find a crime to impeach the President. First, they tried to manufacture evidence that the President colluded with Russia to accomplish this task.

DEVIN NUNES [04:33:56.754 - 04:34:20.069]: The DNC and the Clinton campaign worked with a former British spy Christopher Steele, still assembled a dossier of false information alleging the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. That dossier was largely assembled from Russian and Ukrainian sources that the Democrat contractors worked with next. They prime their hopes on the work of Robert Mueller.

DEVIN NUNES [04:34:20.069 - 04:34:43.383]: Mueller spent two years and millions of taxpayer dollars seeking evidence of a crime that we know wasn't committed. Mueller's failure failure was deficit, a devastating blow to Democrats who clearly hoped his work to be. The basis for the removal of the President today, we are witnessing the Ukraine hoax the direct to TV sequel to the Russia collusion hoax. The plot of the Ukraine hoax is hard to follow.

DEVIN NUNES [04:34:43.383 - 04:35:06.697]: It shifts from day to day first, the Democrats claim, they had evidence of quid pro quo, then extortion and witness intimidation. Now Democrats are pinning their hopes on bribery like any good Hollywood haul. It Hollywood production Democrats needed a screen test before releasing their latest attack. On the President, they leverage the secrecy of the House Intelligence Committee to interview a cast of characters in preparation for these public hearings or the media's enthusiastic support.

DEVIN NUNES [04:35:06.697 - 04:35:30.011]: They built a narrative based on selectively leaked testimony. Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats on this committee are seeking the truth. They would want to know the answers to the following questions that they refuse to ask. To what extent did the whistleblower coordinate with the Democrats on this committee and or his staff?

DEVIN NUNES [04:35:30.011 - 04:35:53.326]: What is the full extent of Ukraine's election meddling against the Trump campaign in 2016? Why did brief him a higher Hunter Biden and what did he do for them and did his position impact any U.S. government actions under the Obama administration, the American people were promised a grave and somber impeachment inquiry.

DEVIN NUNES [04:35:53.326 - 04:36:16.640]: Instead, they got the salacious spy screen comedy that they've been working on for three years. Good night. See you in the morning.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:36:16.650 - 04:36:50.303]: I thank the gentleman and I thank you both for your testimony today. I would highlight a couple things about what we've heard this afternoon. First, investor volcker, your written testimony in which you say in hindsight I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving Ukrainian company Berrimah as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:36:50.303 - 04:37:23.956]: I saw them as very different, the former being appropriate and unremarkable the latter being unacceptable. In retrospect, you said I should have seen that connection differently and had I done so I would have raised my own objections. Ambassador. We appreciate your willingness to amend your earlier testimony in light of what you now know and I think you've made it very clear that knowing what you do today that in fact the President sought an investigation of his political rival, Vice President, Biden, you would not have Countenanced any effort to encourage the Ukrainians to engage in such conduct.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:37:23.956 - 04:37:57.609]: I appreciate also that you were able to debunk I hope for the last time the idea that Joe Biden did something wrong when he -- in accordance with U.S. policy, sought to replace a corrupt prosecutor, something that not only the U.S. State Department wanted not only the European Union wanted and not only the IMF wanted, but was the consensus position of the United States national security infrastructure.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:37:57.609 - 04:38:31.261]: You didn't get a lot of questions about that today as other witnesses did because I think you effectively said that was all nonsense. We appreciate your candor about that. Mr. Morrison. I think what is most remarkable about your testimony is the acknowledgment that immediately after the Vice President met with President Selenski in Warsaw, you witnessed Gordon Sunland meeting with Andre Yarmouk, a top adviser to Presidents at Lenski. And then immediately thereafter, Sunland told you that he had informed the Ukrainians that if they wanted that 400 million in military aid, they were gonna have to do those investigations that the President wanted.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:38:31.261 - 04:39:04.914]: And you were later informed and this is also significant as you've testified here today that the ambassador Sunland at a subsequent conversation with President Trump and informed you that it wasn't going to be enough for the Ukrainian Prosecutor General to announce the investigations. The President wanted President Zelinsky had to do it himself if he wanted to get that aid, let alone the meeting in the White House.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:39:04.914 - 04:39:38.567]: Now you've been asked to opine on the meaning of the term bribery, although you weren't asked to opine on the meeting of the terms high crimes and misdemeanors. But bribery for those watching at home is the conditioning of official acts in exchange for something of personal value. The official acts we're talking about here are a White House meeting that President Zelinsky desperately sought and as you have acknowledged, Ambassador Volker was deeply important to this country at war with Russia to show the United States had this new President's back.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:39:38.567 - 04:40:12.220]: That meeting was important. That meeting is an official act. The military assistance is even more significant because Ukrainians are dying every day in their war with Russia. And so the withholding of military assistance to get these investigations, which you now have acknowledged Ambassador Volker was wrong for the President to request. The idea of withholding that military aid to get these political investigations should be anathema to repugnant to every American because it means the sacrifice not just of Ukrainian national security, but American national security. For the interests of the President personally and politically now my Republican colleagues, all they seem to be upset about with this is not that the President sought an investigation of his political rival, not that he withheld a White House meeting and $400 million in aid. We all pass on a bipartisan basis to pressure Ukraine to do those investigations.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:40:12.220 - 04:40:45.873]: Their objection is he got cut, their objection is that someone blew the whistle and they would like this. Whistleblower identified and the President wants this whistleblower punished, that's their objection, not that the President gauged in this conduct but that he got caught their defenses well. He end up releasing the eight guess after he got caught.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:40:45.873 - 04:41:19.526]: That doesn't make this any less odious americans may be watching this and asking why should the United States care about Ukraine? Why should we care about Ukraine? And this was the import. I think of the conversation. The now infamous conversation that Kiev restaurant with Gordon saw online holding the phone away from his head because the President is talking so loud.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:41:19.526 - 04:41:53.179]: What is the President asking that call the day after the now infamous call he had was the Linsky, What is he asking that cell phone call, not whether the Rada had passed some new anti-corruption reform? No. Are Ukrainians going to do the investigation, meaning into Biden and songlines answer is they're gonna do it. They'll do essentially anything the President wants.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:41:53.179 - 04:42:26.831]: But what's more telling is the conversation I think that Sonia has with a foreign service officer homes afterwards in which the President says basically Donald Trump doesn't give a expletive about Ukraine. He cares about the big things. Mr. Holmes says, Well, Ukraine is at war with Russia. The Russians that's kind of a big thing and someone's answer is no, no, he cares about big things that affect his personal interests.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:42:26.831 - 04:43:00.484]: This is why Americans should care about this. Americans should care about what happens to our allies or dying, but Americans should care about their own national security and their own President and their own constitution and they will need to ask themselves as we will have to ask ourselves in Congress. Are we prepared to accept that a President, nine states can leverage official acts military assistance, White House meetings to get an investigation of a political rival.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:43:00.484 - 04:43:34.137]: Are we prepared to say, well, you know, I guess that's just what we should expect that a President, United States, I don't think we want to go there. I don't think our founding fathers would have wanted us to go there. Indeed. I think when the Founding Fathers provided a remedy that remedy being impeachment, they had the very concern that a President and states may betray the national security interests of the country for personal interests. They put that remedy in the Constitution, not because they wanted to willy nilly overturn elections, no, because they wanted a powerful anti-corruption mechanism when that corruption came from the highest office in the land.

ADAM B. SCHIFF [04:43:34.137 - 04:44:07.790]: We are adjourned, I ask the audience to please allow the witnesses to leave the room before they exit.
